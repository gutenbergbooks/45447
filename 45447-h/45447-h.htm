<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch01' class='c006'>CHAPTER I<br /> <br />NIGHT HAWK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, how I wish I was up there!” muttered
Hal Dane to himself as he cocked an eye upward
into the far heights of the moonlit sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>In mind, Hal Dane was already just below
the stars, riding the clouds in a winged ship;
before him, on imaginary instrument board,
ticked the latest thing in indicator, controller,
tachometer. And all the while, like the other
half of a dual personality, his hands and feet
mechanically guided his rattletrap old truck
along the ruts of the lonesome country road.
On the downgrades Hal’s left hand with skill
of long practice chocked a brakeless wheel
with a wooden block, and on the upgrades his
right foot judiciously kicked a wire that let
on extra “juice” for the pull.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Hillton, Hal’s home village, folks laughed
considerably over the Western Flyer, which a
green daub of paint on the sideboards flaunted
to the world as the ancient truck’s title. But
folks didn’t laugh at the boy who persistently
patched up the rattletrap and drove it. Anyone
knew that it took genius of sorts even to
hold the contraption to the straight road.</p>

<p class='c008'>For all its decrepitude, Hal had to hang on
to the old truck. It furnished his living—and
a living for his mother and his great-uncle
Telemachus, who was “stove-up with rheumatism.”
The weeks when hauling was brisk, the
truck even earned a few strange luxuries such
as queer Hal Dane would want—bottles of
odd-smelling glue, old wire springs and bits
of metal from Kerrigan’s junk pile, and now
and then a precious book full of diagrams of
aeronautical engines.</p>

<p class='c008'>Usually Hal got a chance to make at least
one trip a day, hauling garden truck over the
thirty-mile route from Hillton to Interborough,
the nearest city. On the return trip he’d
bring supplies for the little stores in his home
village and other villages beyond Hillton.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes he had the luck to land a second
sixty-mile round of hauling in one day—like
the present occasion that was bringing him
rattling homeward in the night.</p>

<p class='c008'>Night hauling was wearisome work, and if
it hadn’t been for Hal’s lively imagination he
would have been tempted to doze on his job.
But Hal Dane’s air-minded brain was seething
with spirals and Immelmanns and three-point
landings. One of the great events of his life,
the State Air Meet at Interborough, had been
over for a week, but every flight and entry
was still fresh in the boy’s mind. He lived
them over again. By twist of the imagination
old man Herman’s two milk cans rhythmically
banging against Grocer Kane’s crate of lard
buckets seemed almost the roar of a stunt
plane warming up for action. Hal could almost
think himself into seeing in that empty
stretch of sky above the host of planes that
had formed the “flying circus” of last week.
There had been Rex Raynor, famous pilot who
stunted upside-down; there had been aerial
rope-swingers and ladder-climbers. There
had been—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bang—bong—scre-e-eak!”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a snort of dismay at the clattering
outspilling of his load and the scrape of his
truck as it careened sideways, Hal chocked his
wheel and leaped for the ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jumping catfish!” moaned the lanky, long-legged
blond young trucker as he raced
madly down the road he had just rattled up.
“Ought to have looked back once in a while
’stead of always up at the sky—wouldn’t have
happened then!” And onward he sped, chasing
a runaway wheel.</p>

<p class='c008'>This, though, was no unheard-of performance.
The Western Flyer flung some piece of
its anatomy to the winds on at least every
other trip.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a grunt of satisfaction young Dane
fell upon his miscreant wheel as it thumped to
a standstill in a ditch. Methodically he
trundled it back along the road, jacked up the
ancient truck on the side where its protruding
axle had ploughed the ground for some forty
yards, and set to work repairing damages.</p>

<p class='c008'>An hour later the boy had his wheel cotter-pinned
and hub-capped back into place. As
he slid under the steering gear, he determined
to keep his eyes and his mind out of the sky,
and to concentrate all energies on navigating
the Western Flyer safe into her garage by
dawning.</p>

<p class='c008'>But farther along the road his imagination
began playing him false again. Rhythmic
thump of his load of cans seemed to simulate
whir and zoom of an air engine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Imagination! Was it imagination?</p>

<p class='c008'>All in a quiver of excitement, Hal Dane silenced
his own engine and cocked a listening
ear towards the skies.</p>

<p class='c008'>There it was again—faint hum of a motor
high in the air. An airplane was winging its
way across the forest-covered hills that lay
between Interborough and the railroad gap at
Morris Crossing. No air mail route lay that
way. This must be something out of ordinary;
an important message to be dropped at
the railroad crossing, perhaps.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gosh!” ejaculated Hal to himself. “Speaking
of dreaming things till you really see ’em!
Listen at her coming in!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The plane was swooping nearer; was now
practically above him. Staring upward, Hal
caught a glimpse of the spotlight focused
on the hills below. It was turning from side
to side. The boy looked on with anguish beginning
to clutch at his heart. The motor of
the plane was missing in an alarming manner.
It sputtered and coughed—ran smoothly for
a few seconds, then sputtered again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Trouble!” muttered Hal. “In trouble and
looking for a place to land. There’s no place—unless—”</p>

<p class='c008'>Above him the plane slid crazily on its way.
Now it seemed to hang in the air at a mere
crawl, now it shot onward. At a spot which
Hal judged was a couple of miles distant, the
light became stationary for an instant, then
tipped sharply downward and was swallowed
up by the pine forests on the hills.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A crash!” whispered Hal Dane. He shut
his eyes, then opened them quickly, staring
hard at the moonlit landscape to impress
location on his memory. That jagged pine,
that spur of the hill—it was somewhere between
these that the plane had crashed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Next moment the boy was on the ground
and cranking up his old truck like one possessed.
As it roared into life, he swung aboard
and let her out for all she was worth. In the
case of a human pinned under wreckage in
horrible certainty of fire or suffocation, speed
of rescue must mean the saving of life. So
down the woods road shot Hal, his ancient
truck gallantly riding roots and ruts and
snorting to the charge with a backfire like
gattling guns. A tire blew out and nearly
careened Hal, truck and all into a bank. But
the boy held to the wheel, wrenched her nose
straight to the road and bumped onward. A
second tire burst, and the bumping went on
more evenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the headlights showed an opening
through the trees where great white wings
lay flattened to the earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He made it down—in the only landing place
for miles!” jubilated Hal as he leaped from
the truck and raced toward the grounded
plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he reached the scene of the crash he saw
that the plane really had made a marvelous
landing, merely slightly down-tipped as to
nose, and frame intact save where a sapling
stub had torn a jagged hole through one wing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Minor injuries to the plane—but the man!
The aviator hung limp against the supporting
belt. As the boy loosed buckles and lifted the
pilot out, he felt blood dampen his hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal raced to a stream he remembered crossing.
With his hat full of water, he was back
and kneeling beside the aviator, splashing
water in his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was like a ghost rising from the dead
when the prostrate man flicked open his eyes,
then suddenly—as though some valiant pull
of power within urged him—staggered to his
feet, made a few steps and leaned heavily
against his plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why—” Hal Dane’s mouth dropped open
in amazement as he stared at the figure picked
out whitely in the moonlight, “it’s—it’s Rex
Raynor, famous—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes—yes! Don’t waste time gawking at
me. Need help—got to get this—this packet
on the train—at crossing!” He touched the
bulge of the packet beneath his coat. His eyes
were wild with pain, but somehow he forced
his voice to be steady, even as he forced his
body to stay upright. “Can you help—patch
things—get me off—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” Hal Dane answered, “yes!” At first
he had thought to offer the truck, but two
tires were down and the back axle had steered
in a strangely crooked fashion towards the
end of that wild dash over stumps and boulders.
It might take hours, days, to get the
truck back into running order. The plane—maybe
there was a chance there!</p>

<p class='c008'>First, though, Hal slit open the bloody sleeve
of Raynor’s coat and shirt. From torn strips
of clothing he made bandages over a bullet
wound in the lower left arm, and tightened a
tourniquet above to stop further bleeding.</p>

<p class='c008'>With iron grit Raynor held on to himself—sheer
will power must have kept him from
fainting a dozen times. In his harsh, steady
voice he barked out his orders.</p>

<p class='c008'>The impaling sapling was cut away below
the plane wing. Then the upper length of
wood was worked gently out of the jagged
hole it had torn in the fabric. With quick,
deft fingers Hal Dane whittled repair sticks
out of pieces of pine. Wire from his tool chest
slid in tight coils over wood, under wood, binding
breaks together. Except for his overalls,
Hal had very little clothing left. What hadn’t
gone for tourniquet was now masquerading
as wing fabric. Tire glue had to do duty as
“dope” to lacquer smooth the patched wing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rex Raynor, flyer, was too pain-dazed for
his mind to give even passing thought to the
strangeness of his finding, out here in the pine
woods, a long-legged youth whose nimble fingers
seemed expert at splicing framework and
patching wing fabric. The trouble he was in
tensed his nerves to breaking point. His one
idea was, “The packet must go on—the packet
must reach the safety of railroad officials at
Morris Crossing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In between directions for repair work and
frantic urgings for haste, Raynor muttered
broken details of the disaster that had befallen
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Blue prints—aerial engine designs for the
Nevo-Avilly contest—finished too late to submit
even by air mail—rushing to get packet
aboard mail car at crossing. Nobody supposed
to know of his engine designs. As Raynor
crossed level by forest ranger’s hut, a red
rocket, distress signal, had shot into the sky,
signaling him to a landing. Knowing that the
ranger, a former flying pal, had been disabled
by illness, Raynor had answered the silent
call by gliding to earth to render aid in some
emergency. Instead of the ranger, a masked
bandit had leaped upon the aviator, demanding
the packet, even before switch could be
cut or motor throttled. In the ensuing fight
Raynor had got winged in the arm by a close
range bullet, but had managed to shake off
his assailant, and had risen to the safety of
the airways in his plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>Knowing that one such daredevil attack
would likely mean further pursuit, Raynor
fought off bodily pain and strove to keep his
mind fixed to one purpose—getting the packet
aboard the U. S. mail train.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flyer completed examination by electric
torch of landing-gear, engine, wings, Hal’s
last improvised piece of patchwork that was
hardening miraculously under its spread of
tire glue.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have done well—it is good!” exulted
Raynor, as with the boy’s help he trundled the
plane backwards to get room for the take-off.
“We have twenty minutes—we will make it.”
He motioned Hal to climb into the front
cockpit.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a breath Hal Dane stood rigid. At last
it had come—his chance to ride in a real plane!
But he stood motionless. This man Raynor—fever
burned like delirium in his eyes, he
fairly staggered from weakness. A risky pilot
to ride with! And yet the courage in that iron
set of jaw, the determination that drove a
pain-weakened body to serve the will! Raynor
had come this far—Raynor would carry
on to the end. And Hal Dane would be in at
that ending.</p>

<p class='c008'>A thrill shot through the boy as he made his
lightning-quick decision and climbed breathlessly
aboard.</p>

<p class='c008'>Raynor cranked the motor with his one
good hand, kicked aside a wood chunk that
had blocked the wheels, and scrambled heavily
into the rear cockpit. With a roar the plane
moved across the clearing, gathered speed,
lifted within two hundred yards of the tree
line. They were up and off, a thousand feet
above earth!</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal Dane’s blood pounded, he gasped for
breath. Then he relaxed into a feeling of keen
delight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal Dane actually flying! The boy knew
instinctively that from now on flying was to
be his real life. He had managed this one time
to skim the clouds. Somehow he would manage
it again and again.</p>

<p class='c008'>Raynor had ascended rapidly. Two thousand
feet below them the pine forests lay like
flat dark carpets. Little rivers and streams
were like silver threads reflecting the moonlight.
In the distance a row of small, swift-moving
lights must be the east-bound mail
train they were racing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Looking earthward from the heights stirred
no qualm, no dizziness in the boy. He felt at
ease, in his own peculiar element. Turning
his mind backward, it seemed that every event
in his life had culminated in this engine-powered
flight with wings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even as Hal’s serene gaze sought the pinpoints
of trees and the silver dots of water on
the earth below, the great plane shot higher,
looped downward, aimed her nose at the stars
again. After that came a sensation of falling,
then a careening, tipping of wings from side
to side.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rise, fall, dip—all consumed mere space of
a breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal Dane whirled around from his earth
gazing, to steal a glance at the pilot behind
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was reason for those wing-dips. Rex
Raynor hung in a fainting huddle across his
strap. Almost at the glorious end of his race
for time, the flyer’s iron will had lost its fight
against pain.</p>

<p class='c008'>Raynor’s ship was a teaching boat, outfitted
with dual controls. Between Hal’s knees rose
a stick, mate to the control from which the
pilot’s hand had fallen.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instinctively Hal Dane’s hand shot out to
grasp this lever. His one desire was to shove
with all his power on the
gear,—forward—back—anywhere, to
steady this awful tipping,
skidding roll that was hurling the boat downward.
But even as Hal’s hand touched the
knob of the stick, reason surged through his
brain like a shout of “Wait, wait! Death lies
that way!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Reason was right. Hal’s fingers clenched
into palm to keep from seizing the gear. He
must think it out, know what he must do before
he ever shoved that lever a hair’s breadth.
With cold sweat bursting out to drench him,
and his brain prickling to the terror of falling,
falling,—yet Hal Dane held himself rigid, eyes
closed, while in his mind’s eye he made himself
see again the paper diagram of a Wright
motor’s control board. In his own cluttered
old workshop at home he had memorized
every movement of manipulating ailerons, elevators,
rudder. Memory must save his and
another’s life now.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Hal opened his eyes again, his stiff
lips were muttering, “Stick pushed forward,
manipulates elevators—plane descends; pulled
back, plane rises; pushed to right, operates
ailerons for right wing bank; left, for left
bank—”</p>

<p class='c008'>To the boy mere moments had seemed hours
of hurling earthward. He felt that the very
tree tops must soon be dragging at the landing
gear, crippling the plane for its crash. He
longed desperately to look, to see just what
space lay between him and death.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead, for two dreadful seconds, he forced
calm eyes to study the control board, forced
his hand to hold the fat knob of the stick in
a firm grip, to pull back—gently, gently.</p>

<p class='c008'>And gently the ship lifted. Descent changed
to ascent.</p>

<p class='c008'>A sob of relief tore through the boy’s throat.
They were going up, up! The waving octopus
arms of the tree tops could not snare them to
death now.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seemed he could never get enough of
going up. He was above the clouds now. The
ship answered beautifully to every touch on
the controls. A slight pressure on the stick
to the right operated ailerons and the right
wing dropped to form a right bank that
drifted the ship in a wide, lazy circle.</p>

<p class='c008'>The response of the mechanism was wonderful.
It was like a living thing that moved
at a touch. Hal Dane felt lifted on wings of
his own.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he passed beyond the bank of clouds.
Two thousand feet below him on the earth
crawled a tiny earthworm thing strung with
lights—the mail train, the crossing!</p>

<p class='c008'>Elation ebbed from young Dane’s mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the sky heights was safety. On the
ground below lurked death, awaiting the
slightest mischance in landing.</p>

<p class='c008'>And yet Hal Dane must come down to a
forced landing—now—immediately. He was
not here to skim the clouds for exhilarating
joy. He must rush a wounded man and an important
packet to the train crossing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Slowly young Dane circled earthward. And
each downdrift laid a chill of terror on his
heart. Now that he was coming to earth,
earth looked most unnatural. Morris Crossing
should be familiar ground; yet viewed in
the white moonlight from over a plane edge,
all things took on monstrously strange proportions.
In his terror Hal began to feel that
he could not distinguish a field from a forest,
a road from a river. He might smash across
housetops, might hurl himself, plane and all,
into the moving train before he could stop.
No, he could not do this thing, could not! If
gasoline held out, he could drift in mid-air till
morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>In answer to his sudden tense pressure, the
elevator was pulled so hard that the machine
all but stalled, then fortunately cleared off
and zoomed upward at intense speed.</p>

<p class='c008'>High air—safety again!</p>

<p class='c008'>But Hal Dane was no coward. Up in the
heights, his brain seemed to cool. The train
was coming in. It was a matter of seconds.
And he must meet that train with the packet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Coolly he began to map in his mind the lay
of the ground close to Morris Crossing. There
was the group of small houses, the improvised
box-car waiting-room, a storehouse, behind
that an empty, rolling stretch of field. That
was his chance. He must somehow land in
that field.</p>

<p class='c008'>A week ago, at the Air Meet in Interborough,
Hal had watched innumerable airplanes
cut motors and circle down. He had studied
and read everything on aviation he could lay
hands on—he knew exactly what he ought
to do. But actually to do it! A terror chill
quivered up the boy’s spine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he set teeth, coolly stopped the
motor, pressed into a bank that began to drop
the plane in great circles. Dane tried to remember
everything at once—best to volplane
down in spirals of a certain size—must flatten
off to save a nose dive—must—</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the black earth came up to meet Hal
Dane.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch02' class='c009'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />WINGS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When Hal Dane came to himself, lanterns
and electric torches on all sides bobbed crisscross
lights above him. A dozen hands seemed
pulling and tugging to extricate him from the
one-sided crash of plane wreckage.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was laid out on the ground. A wet handkerchief
mopped blood out of his eyes. He
felt broken all over. Through a mist of pain
he heard voices frantically calling, “Send for
Doc! Get Doctor Joe!”</p>

<p class='c008'>But something more than the pain and the
voices beat in his brain—a throbbing “chug-chug-chug”
that stirred him out of his apathy.
The train, the eastbound that he’d raced!</p>

<p class='c008'>“G-get me up,” he croaked hoarsely. “Hold
that train—mail packet—im-m-mportant—no,
no, no!” He fought away hands that
strove to hold him quiet. His struggles seemed
to clear his brain, give him strength to rise.
“Don’t doctor me, doctor him,” pointing to
Raynor, “he’s injured, bad off! Me—I—I’m
not dead yet, not by a l-long shot!” and Hal
even managed a white-lipped grin.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was pain to walk. But the urge to complete
what he had undertaken drove him on.
From Raynor’s coat, thrown aside by Doc Joe
who was probing the bullet wound, Hal extracted
the thick envelope. After an eternity
of putting one foot before the other foot, he
got it delivered at the mail car of the long
train that Mr. Tilton, the rotund little station
agent, was importantly holding.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the train pulled out, there was still
one more job to attend to. “That airplane,
Mr. Tilton,” he begged of the fat little agent.
“Don’t let cows get at it—or people poke
around too much. And maybe you’d better
rope what’s left of it to the fence. Big wind—might—come
up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The urge had spent its force. Hal Dane felt
a thousand years old all at once. He sank
wearily into the spidery, yellow-painted little
car of Fuzzy McGinnis, his chum, whom all
this excitement had summoned to the scene.
Fuz understood. Fuz had been in smash-ups
himself. In silent sympathy, and keeping the
Yellow Spider throttled to a gentle gait, he
carted Hal the half mile from Morris Gap to
Hillton.</p>

<p class='c008'>Doc Joe, in his own car, was bringing Rex
Raynor also to the Danes’ hospitable, ramshackle
old house.</p>

<p class='c008'>After his mother, Mary Dane, wild-eyed
with fear, but holding to her calm, had gone
over him for broken bones, that she didn’t
find, and had bound up his head better and
had poured hot milk down him,—and after
Uncle Telemachus had excitedly heard the
story of the air crash three times—Hal
crawled into bed and slept a round of the clock.</p>

<p class='c008'>Next day Hal Dane’s sturdy constitution asserted
itself and yanked him out from any
lazy coddling between the sheets. His scalp
might still show some split skin from bucking
a wire strut, and bruises the size of plates and
saucers decorate him here and there, but he’d
better be thanking his stars he wasn’t disabled.
And Hal did thank ’em! His work was needing
him too. The truck that earned the family
living was idling up there in the pine woods.</p>

<p class='c008'>Need to get back to work rested heavily on
Hal’s shoulders, but worse than that was a
worry burden that weighted down his heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Hal, cap in hand and a bag of tools thrust
under one arm, tiptoed down the long hall
whose once beautifully plastered walls now
gaped in ugly cracks, he paused before the
room Rex Raynor was in. The door swung
half open in the summer breeze. Hal stepped
in, stood uncertain, twisting his cap into a
knot. He opened his mouth once or twice as
if he were trying to speak and couldn’t. Then
finally he blurted out:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Raynor, I—it’s awful that I smashed
your plane—I, oh—some day—I’ll try—pay—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Huh!” snorted the recumbent Raynor,
slightly raising his head and glaring with
fiery eyes beneath beetling brows. “Huh, come
here!” His injured left arm, grotesquely enlarged
by bandages, lay on a supporting pillow.
But with his right hand, he beckoned
imperiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal came to the bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you ever fly a sky bus before?” questioned
Raynor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not—not a real plane,” answered Hal.
“I’ve got books and—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Boy,” said Raynor, reaching out his good
hand and pulling him close, “boy, you’re a
wonder. You brought us down alive—in the
night. More’n some trained pilots can do.
Wing sense must have been born in you. And
say,” Raynor’s brows drew up fiercely again,
“get that pay idea off your chest. I owe you
more than you owe me. If you hadn’t been a
plucky youngster to go up with me and bring
down my wind bus by book learning, I’d—I’d
have crashed to a dead one. That’s sure!”
Raynor shut his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal eased out of the room. His head and
his heart felt suddenly, gloriously light and
tingling. He hadn’t known what a burden
he’d carried—until now that it had lifted. His
spirit was free again.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the crash where, in that last downward
swoop, he had evidently pulled the
wrong mechanism and tipped the plane to a
dangerous turn, an obsession of distrust had
oppressed him. He had begun to fear that he
lacked air sense, was not fitted for the fulfilment
of his dreams of wings and the airways.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now with one lift of his brows, a wave
of the hand, Rex Raynor had dispelled the
gloom. What was it Raynor had said—“Wing
sense—born in him!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal flung himself through the front door
and down the steps so excitedly that he near
toppled over his red-headed friend Fuz
McGinnis, who was rushing up the steps.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you think you are—a Wright
Whirlwind Motor?” Fuz fiercely rubbed a
barked shin. “Here I was thinking you an invalid,
and hopped by to say I’d take the Yellow
Spider and tow in the truck from the pine
woods for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t believe my famous vehicle needs any
towing-in,” answered Hal, “but I’ll be thankful
to have you haul my carcass and these
tools out there, and apply some of your manly
strength to helping me jack the old bus up.”
And linking arms with Fuz, Hal strode off
toward the yellow roadster.</p>

<p class='c008'>For Rex Raynor, his week’s stay in the
shabby old Dane home was a period of mixed
pain and pleasure. At first his arm wound
throbbed irritatingly, and added to it was the
anxiety for the condition of his crashed plane.
But these pleasant, kindly people among whom
Fate had dropped him were an interesting
compensation.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was Mother Mary Dane. She was a
little woman with blue eyes and lots of soft
brown hair that was usually wound into a firm,
tight knot, because there was never any time
to primp it up and do it fluffily. When the
fever pains let the aviator up from his bed and
allowed him the run of the place, he marveled
at the amount of work a slip of a woman like
Mary Dane could “turn off.” He seemed to
find her always churning, or stooped over
everlasting “taken-in” sewing, or on her knees
with garden trowel in her hand. Her mouth
would be a stubborn line combating the weariness
of her eyes, offsetting the whiteness of
her face—only folks didn’t often catch her like
that. When she saw Raynor or Hal or Uncle
Tel coming, she could usually produce a smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the sun shone warm and bright, from
a big room at the end of the hall would arise
snatches of quavery whistling, thump of hammering.
That would be Uncle Telemachus
Harrison enjoying a “good day.” Uncle Tel
was Hal’s great-uncle. When the sunshine
eased his rheumatism, he pounded away at
chair repairing and odd jobs to help along
with the very limited family exchequer.
Uncle Tel Harrison was a curiosity—a fiery
little man with bright blue eyes and a bristling,
bushy mustache.</p>

<p class='c008'>As great a curiosity as Uncle Tel was the
old house. Hal’s mother was a Harrison and
had inherited the ancient dwelling from her
people.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Harrison house had been two-storied.
Then the roof fell in. Hal and Uncle Tel, with
very little outside help, had cobbled up some
sort of roof over the remaining lower story.
In the bleakness of winter, the makeshift,
curling shingles and the warped walls must
have looked their pitifulness. But now in the
summer, when the cudzu vine was in its
swathing glory, the old cobbled-up house
looked rather quaint and cool under its dress
of vines.</p>

<p class='c008'>Back of the tumbledown dwelling was a
tumbledown barn that had once housed the
high-stepping Harrison horses. Now it housed
some strange contraptions beneath its sagging
roof.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Rex Raynor went out to that old
stable under the voluble and excited escort
of Uncle Telemachus, he was amazed at the
variety and perfection of things aeronautical
that he found there.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just look at ’em,” chortled Uncle Tel, waving
a gnarled hand about the barn workshop
to include little models of gliders, models of
planes in paper and wood, some tattered books
on aviation mechanics, and a crude man-sized
glider made of wood strips and cloth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Looks like this one’s seen real usage.”
Raynor’s eyes lighted up with interest as he
laid a hand on various splicings of the wood
and huge patches on the fabric.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My sakes alive,” sputtered Uncle Tel, “I’ll
say it’s been used! That crazy boy’s always
rigging himself up in something like this, and
having the kids from the village pull him off
down that bare slope of old Hogback Hill.
Sometimes he’d achieve a pretty good float before
he’d drift to the plain at the hill bottom.
He achieved his head bumped, too, a score of
times, a shoulder wrenched, arms and legs
knocked up—but dang it, he keeps on trying
the thing!” Uncle Tel’s voluble complaining
was belied by the prideful glint in his old blue
eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And what does Mother Mary Dane think of
all this gliding and head bumping?” laughed
the flyer, turning to Mrs. Dane who had just
come in.</p>

<p class='c008'>She stood there, a hand resting on the glider
wing. The eyes she lifted held a glow of pride,
but around those eyes anxiety had etched its
own lines too.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Umph, Mary, she’s got sense—if I do say
it,” grunted Uncle Telemachus. “She knows
it ain’t any more use to try to keep an air-minded
boy out of the air than it is to try to
keep a water-minded duck out of the water.
Mary, she’s shed tears over his busted head
and banged-up shoulders considerable times.
But shedding tears didn’t keep Mary from
giving her wing-sprouting offspring all ten of
the linen sheets she heired off her Grandma
Harrison. Real linen sheets and a silver spoon
or two was all there was left to descend to
Mary. Grandma Harrison would turn over
in her grave if she knew just what an end her
good hand-woven cloth had come to. A whole
sheet ragged up on a hawthorn bush where
Glider Number One went gefluey in a gulley
and spilled Hal for a row of head wallops.
Another burned to a crisp when some invention
of wing lacquer combustulated and liked
to have fired us all out of house and home.
There’s four on that glider contraption, and
the rest of ’em—the rest of ’em—” With a
guilty look, Uncle Tel clapped a hand to mouth
and went off into a hasty fit of coughing. He
turned away and stamped down the length of
the shop where he began to putter with some
spruce sticks and a lathe.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he rejoined the others, Raynor was
saying:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Didn’t Hal drop a few hints that he was
going to do some gliding for my benefit to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I fear so.” Mary Dane’s lips quirked up
in a smile, but her hand was flung out nervously.
“And just look at that innocent little
wind cloud lazying out there on the horizon!
It could roll up into anything. I tell Hal that
every time he even plans a glide, his subconscious
mind stirs up a wind somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s he going to take off in—this?”
Raynor touched the battered glider.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gosh, no—er-r—” Uncle Tel joined the
conversation, then sputtered off distractedly,
“er-r—well, you just wait and see!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c009'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br />FLYING HOPE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Interborough got wind of the near-robbery,
the wild sky-ride, the subsequent crash of a
great plane on the outskirts of Hillton. A
horde of reporters swarmed over to interview
the crashees, to get pictures of them and the
wreck. For the first time in his life, Hal Dane
saw himself staring, with the usual garbled,
wood-cut expression of newspaper pictures,
from the front page of a metropolitan paper.
But if the picture was poor, Harry Nevin, the
young reporter for the Interborough Star,
had at least wielded a kindly pencil. In spite
of the crash, he gave Hal Dane credit for
“unusual wing sense.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In reality as well as in the smeary newspaper
picture the wrecked plane showed up as
a dismal mess. To the uninitiated eye, this
grotesque thing with its tail in the air and its
nose in the mud had all the appearances of
having flown its last flight. But when mechanics
from Interborough, with Raynor to
direct them, began to dig out the ship, it was
found that the actual damage was done only
to the propeller, although the fuselage and
wings were covered with mud and some of the
wing fabric would have to be patched and
“doped.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s that ditch that did it,” consoled Raynor,
going over the various aspects of the
“cracked-up” landing with Hal. “In the night
that grass-covered ditch couldn’t have looked
much different from the rest of the field. But
a ditch for a landing place can turn most any
sky bus into a bronco-bucking affair. Nearly
every pilot mixes in with something of the
kind sooner or later. Settling in a little gully
out in Texas about seven years ago gave me
a wallop in the bean that I won’t be forgetting
any time soon,” and Raynor ducked his head
to show Hal a jagged white scar that persistently
parted his black hair unevenly at the
crown.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as a new propeller could be shipped
out and adjusted, one of the flyer’s friends
from the air mail route was coming down to
pilot off both Raynor and his ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>So the next day, in spite of a few rolling,
murky wind clouds in the east, Hal determined
to do some gliding on his homemade
apparatus. He wanted this chance to get a
real aviator’s criticism and advice on the
board and cloth mechanisms with which he
had to satisfy his longings for air flight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal Dane might have wing sense, but he
had no money with which to buy engine-powered
wings. All he could do was patch up
contrivances out of the crude materials that
lay to hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Long ago Hillton had ceased to throw up
its hands and fall in a faint over that “crazy
Dane boy” scudding along gully edges propelled
by a pair of sheets stretched on some
sticks. In fact, Hillton had grown so used to
Hal’s experimenting that by now the village
just accepted him and his stunts as a matter
of course.</p>

<p class='c008'>But with the famous Rex Raynor present
and evincing interest in such things, the whole
of Hillton turned out to watch this new gliding
attempt of Hal’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of rolling out the battered little
glider that reposed in the main workshop,
Hal, with considerable help from all the small
boys of Hillton, pushed back a section of the
opposite wall, revealing that the barn had a
second long room—the harness or storage
room of the old days. From out of this,
scraping and screaking along the ground on
its keel skid, was hauled a white monstrosity—a
huge thing of wood and cloth, of wires
and bars and levers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hilltonians who hadn’t seen the latest of
Hal’s handicraft couldn’t resist a laugh at the
ungainly monster with long, warped-looking
stretch of wing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gangway, gangway!” shouted a youngster.
“Here comes the Willopus-Wallopus!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Willopus, your foot!” snorted Uncle Telemachus.
He himself might laugh a bit at Hal,
but he wasn’t going to stand for anybody else
doing it. He silenced the mouthy boy with a
glare from his fiery old eyes. “Hi, don’t you
know a wind bird when you see one?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Wind bird, indeed! To the uninitiated, this
cloth contraption stretched on hay-bale wire
and sprucewood sticks, hauled out of its lair
on its screakily protesting keel skid, looked
more like some waddling antediluvian from
the prehistoric past.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Rex Raynor seemed to find nothing
comical in the wind bird. Her slow progress
while being dragged to the brow of Hogback
Hill gave him a chance to study her every
line. To an aviator used to the exquisite
finish and polish of a modern factory-built sky
boat, Hal’s contraption offered a contrast of
a rather sketchy aircraft fuselage. A little
board, an upright post, some slim sprucewood
longerons,—that was the fuselage, if one
could call it a fuselage! But for all its homemade
roughness, there was an interesting
compactness in the way the boy had braced
his few wires and uprights down to a “V,”
converging at the board seat. The one wing
was a long cloth-covered affair of wood
strips and wires—streamlined after a fashion,
for it was narrower at the tips than in the
center, and thinner at the back edge than at
the front edge. The longerons ended in rudimentary
elevators and rudder, connected by
wires to a pair of pedals set before the board
seat that was fastened at the nose of the
fuselage. A broomstick control stuck up before
the seat too, and wires hitched it to the
wings.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The boy’s worked out something, eh?”
grunted Uncle Tel, shuffling rheumatically
alongside of Raynor, who seemed bent on
studying every inch of the curious, lumbering
craft. “Got some technique all his own, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cat’s back!” snorted the flyer, “but I’ll say
the kid’s got technique!” He laid a hand on
one of the hinged sections that formed the
back of each wing tip. “Look at those
ailerons he worked out on the wings! He’s
combined the idea of the German Taube and
the French Nomet in that wing lift. Where
did he get it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Got it out of his head—and from watching
birds fly, too, I reckon,” said Uncle Tel.
“That boy, he’s always snatching time to sit
out here on the top of old Hogback Hill,
watching buzzards sail, crows flap, and how
the lark gives a little spring when she sails
up into the sky. Looky here, see that sort of
spring, set there where the glider rests on
its skid? That’s what Buddy calls his ‘lark
spring up.’ It helps him get gliding in a
shorter run than he could before he put it
there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The glider and its escort had about reached
the crest of the hill now. Raynor stepped a
little apart and stood looking down over the
lay of the land below him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Um—valleys and bare rolling hills,” he
muttered to himself. “The sort of terrain
below to make air currents that rise and flow.
The kid’s a good picker of gliding country.
Reckon though he’s been experimenting and
studying out this air current business for himself.
He’s not exactly the kind to leave
everything to mere blind chance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal Dane jammed his old cap down on his
head nearly to the ears, stood a moment beside
his glider. He was a tall, fair boy—fair
at least if he hadn’t been so outrageously
tanned. His eyes had the Norse hint of “blue
fire” to them, like the blue fire of the ice glint
of the far north. For a fact, the boy had more
than a hint of the old Norse Viking look to
him as he stood there beside his wind ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>His mother, in the fore-edge of the crowd,
hands nervously twisting but chin up and
eyes steady, might have been the mother of a
Viking. Only, instead of watching a son take
boat for unknown sea currents, this mother
was watching a son mount the even more unknown
air currents.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ducking down to get in under the overhanging
wing, Hal seated himself on the
board, rammed his back against the upright
post that formed the main member of his
skeleton fuselage, then doubled up his long
legs to set feet on the pair of pedals.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was rather good sport, this starting Hal
off on a flight. The Hillton youngsters had
plenty of experience in their end of the matter—which
was the pushing and pulling off. On
this occasion, when there were so many onlookers,
it was a matter to be fought over.
Fuz McGinnis, acting as master of ground
ceremonies, straightened affairs out and selected
those that had already had some experience
in pulling off.</p>

<p class='c008'>At a signal from Hal, half a dozen fellows,
three to the left and three to the right,
walked away with the ends of a rope that led
back in a “V” to the front of the wind bird.
At the tip of one wing a tall boy trotted along
to hold the wings level. Behind the wind
bird, Fuz and another fellow came ambling
along, pulling back slightly on a tail rope.</p>

<p class='c008'>At twenty steps down the hill, Hal shouted,
“Run!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The contraption, which had been slipping
along the ground on its keel skid, rose a few
feet as the runners picked up speed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ten paces more, and the pilot crouching up
there under the wing yelled, “Turn loose!
Let her go!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Already the fellow at the wing had stood
away. At the yell “Let her go!” the others
dropped ropes, which fell free from the down-pointed
hooks they had been merely held
against by pressure. Now with the back pull
relaxed, the glider shot upward and forward
like a stone hurled from a catapult.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wedged between some spruce sticks under
a stretch of cloth, Hal was off on his motorless
flight.</p>

<p class='c008'>When on the ground this contraption of
wood and wires had seemed an ungainly,
waddling freak. But now as it soared upward
on air currents in its sky-element, it swooped
with a marvel of grace.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of a short flight and a mere slide
down a wind hill, the boy began to twist and
turn to take advantage of every rising current
of air so as to ascend to a greater height
than that from which he had started.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though he couldn’t hear it, the crowd below
him let out a gasp of admiration. Rex Raynor
stood, head bent back so as not to miss a
movement of the rider of the wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>Already the wind bird had climbed a hundred
feet above the take-off; it banked again
for another climb. Now it circled, swept in a
series of loops, and began to drift easily down
a landing at the foot of the starting hill.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then through the valley swept a gust from
the wind clouds that had been rolling up all
day. Like a leaf the lazily dropping wind
machine was caught up in the blast, swept
high again, hurled this way and that, dipping
crazily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gosh!” shrieked Fuz McGinnis in a bleat
of terror. “Oh, my gosh! He’s going to head
on his stand!” Fuz always said his words hind
part before when he got excited.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c009'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />WINDS OF CHANCE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Caught in a swirl of air currents, Hal Dane
and his craft were hurled this way and that
like some toy shot from a giant’s hand.
Watchers below held their breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although a hundred feet and more intervened
between them, those on the ground
could see that the boy in the air was exerting
every ounce of craftsmanship in his battle with
the wind. He banked to the right, now dipped
and rose, as though striving to ride the twist
of air currents flowing about him, instead of
drifting helplessly in their battering clutch.
At times the wind ship seemed to whirl completely
around, yet mostly it was held to an
even keel.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the heavens opened and the rain came
down in torrents; preluded by lightning and
thunder, a cold blast swept down the valley
with something of the fury of a small cyclone.
Caught in this tempest, the crude plane
bucked and went rearing upward like an affrighted
horse.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There goes the last of Grandma Harrison’s
sheets,” roared Uncle Tel, hardly conscious of
what he was saying and charging through the
crowd as though he, on his rheumatic old
limbs, would keep up with that flying white in
the sky above.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There goes my boy!” thought Mary Dane.
It was a silent prayer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Higher than it had ever gone before surged
the wind bird. Storm, darkness, and rain
seemed to cut it off from men’s sight.</p>

<p class='c008'>The crowd began to run down the valley,
letting the push of the wind guide them in the
direction the aircraft must surely be following
also. Clinging wet garments and the rain
torrent made progress heartbreakingly slow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fuz McGinnis turned and began a stumbling
progress against the wind back towards
the starting point at Hogback. After a while
he reappeared, charging along over the roadless,
stony valley in his grotesquely inadequate
looking Yellow Spider. Into it he somehow
crowded Mrs. Dane and Uncle Tel. Others
turned back and went for their cars. Raynor
caught a ride with someone. Quite a procession
went skidding and lumbering through
the rain-washed valley.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, as quickly as it had come, the summer
storm cleared. The sun even came out.</p>

<p class='c008'>Something white showed up, flapping dismally
in a distant tree top. It must be the
remains of the wind bird. It—it couldn’t be
anything else.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fuz let out the yellow cut-down, speeding
by stumps, dodging boulders. From the car
behind him he could hear Raynor’s voice
urging on the driver.</p>

<p class='c008'>These two cars were by far and away the
lead of practically the entire population of
Hillton that surged running, walking, riding
down the valley.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mary Dane, and Raynor not far behind her
were the first to reach that tree with its
flaunting ragged streamers of the wrecked
windcraft. Hal was not lying at its foot,
battered and crashed. Instead, with blood on
his face, and his clothes half torn off, he was
gingerly lowering himself from branch to
branch. He shinned on down the trunk,
dropped beside his mother, and fair picked her
up in a great boyish bear hug.</p>

<p class='c008'>Above him, half of the wind bird hung in
streaming tatters from a couple of tree
branches. The other half had already descended
and lay like a vast white splotch on
the ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Reckon I’d better go get the truck and
haul this in,” said Hal, using his fist to mop
blood out of his eye from a cut on the forehead.
“I’m sort of used to hauling in the remains
and patching up things after every
flight. I—”</p>

<p class='c008'>As man to man, Raynor clapped him on the
shoulder and thrust out a hand. “Put her
there!” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—er—had the luck to land in the soft part
of a tree. I—I got down anyway,” said Hal
gruffly to hide the emotion that was stirring
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You got down—but you did more! Man,
man! Without any engine, on some sheets
strung on sticks, you flew to the clouds,
banked, dipped, soared with the best of them,
till that whirlwind caught you. Prettiest
thing I’ve seen in years.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If only that wrong wind hadn’t got me,”
moaned Hal.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If!” said Raynor, narrowing his eyes.
“Aviation’s full of ifs, boy—don’t let ’em—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I won’t,” said Hal, grinning in spite of the
fact that half of his best wind bird was dangling
from a branch in a tree top.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>The next day Rex Raynor was leaving.
Pilot Osburn had come down to fly him off in
the now fully repaired airplane. After a
warm handclasp for all the friends into whose
kindness he had dropped, Raynor started to
climb up into the cockpit of the R.H.3. Then
he stepped back to ground, drew out a notebook
and wrote a few lines. He turned to
Hal.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I expected to write you a letter about this.
But,” with a grin, “aviation’s too full of ifs,
so—thought I might as well attend to it now
while we’re together. You saved my life.
And you’re not the kind of a chap I can get a
reward off on. But there’s something I want
to do for you, and this note will tell you what.”
He slid the piece of paper into Hal’s pocket,
then climbed up into his plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pilot removed the blocks, the motor
roared, and the R.H.3 taxied forward and
zoomed into the air. The boy stared upward
until the great plane grew small, became a
mere speck, disappeared beyond the horizon.
Then he silently turned away from the crowd
and headed towards home, walking fast. He
rather wanted to get into the privacy of his
own old workshop before he opened Raynor’s
note.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c009'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />CHALLENGING THE AIR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Once within the quiet silence of the old
workshop Hal plumped down on a sawhorse
and pulled the note out of his pocket.</p>

<p class='c008'>Quickly he unfolded the paper, and gave a
gasp at the contents. It was a note scribbled
to the head of the Rand-Elwin Flying School,
saying: “Here’s a real air-minded boy who
risked his life for a flyer. He wants to become
one of us, and all he’ll need is work to
pay for lessons. I think you could use such a
boy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal Dane’s head was in a whirl as he read
and re-read the few scribbled lines. Hal had
every right to feel dizzy. Raynor’s words
were suddenly opening up and making real to
him certain vague, misty dreams he had
desperately believed would somehow materialize
in a far, far distant future.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead, they were materializing now—right
now—immediately. The boy sitting
rigid on the old sawhorse suddenly shut his
eyes, as if the realized dreams were too
dazzlingly bright. Flying school—actual
training! He’d live with planes—eat, sleep,
dream with planes—till he knew every inch
of the real machinery of aeromotors. Then
a pilot’s license! That would open the world
for him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal Dane would fly a real plane—make real
money. His vision traveled fast. Mother
should have everything. No more bending
over “taken-in” sewing with weariness pains
lacing her bent back and lines deepening in
her face. Uncle Tel should have all the pipes,
all the books he wanted. They’d do over the
old house, renovate it back to its former two-storied
elegance, paint, flowers—he’d—the
dream circled back on itself and began all
over again at airships, Hal Dane aviator!</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal slid down off the saw bench. He’d
write the letter to Rand-Elwin—now.</p>

<p class='c008'>That same day’s mail carried Hal’s letter to
the Flying School, a fervid boyish epistle
stating how enthusiastically hard he’d work if
they would only give him the chance. Pinned
to it was Raynor’s all-important scribble.</p>

<p class='c008'>A week’s space brought the answer. It was
a business-like typed sheet signed by the Mr.
Rand of the Rand-Elwin.</p>

<p class='c008'>Crowded as they were with pay students,
it was out of the ordinary, he wrote, for them
to take one to work out his tuition expenses.
But the written recommendation from Mr.
Raynor (one of their former men), also a
personal visit from him pertaining to this
matter in hand, had inclined the school to
change its policy in this case. Work would be
found for him in the hangars or in the corps
of mechanicians. He could expect no money
pay for this, of course, but instead would receive
the much greater pay of free tuition,
board and lodging at the barracks. From
Raynor’s recommendation, they were expecting
great work from him, an interesting flying
future—</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal’s eyes traveled back from the pleasant
prophecy that closed the communication,—traveled
back and riveted upon “no money
pay.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It had been foolish of him, of course, but
somehow he had never figured at all that
there would be “no money pay.” He had
rosily visioned himself as pulling down some
neat sum for his probable labors at sweeping
hangars, trundling grease cans, blocking and
unblocking plane wheels. Half of this money
would have gone to pay flying-tuition, most of
the other half would have gone to the folks
back home. In his visioning he had slept in
some corner of a hangar, had eaten any old
fare.</p>

<p class='c008'>But now, no money coming in at all, that
was different! The vision seemed closing up,
drifting away. Mother and Uncle Tel had to
eat. He hadn’t earned much, but he had
earned something, enough to keep their little
household going, anyway.</p>

<p class='c008'>He’d have to stick at this truck job that
paid even a pittance of real money—give up
this flying vision, this Rand-Elwin offer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Oh, but how could he? This, his first real
chance! In reality it was a full generous
thing the Rand-Elwin people were willing to
do. They were offering lodging, board and
something like a thousand dollars in tuition in
exchange for the part-time work of an unknown
boy. Only the recommendation of a
valuable man like Raynor could have secured
him this.</p>

<p class='c008'>His mother, eyes flashing, head held high,
insisted stoutly that of course he must go—his
chance—he must take it. Why, she’d manage!</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal knew exactly how Mary Dane would
manage. Sewing, and more sewing, and a
pain in the side most of the time. She had
put him through high school that way.
Mothers were like that, always insisting that
they could do the impossible—and doing it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Well, his mother had sacrificed herself
enough for him. Hal shut his lips fiercely.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next day his answer went back to the
Rand-Elwin Flying School, a letter very different
from that first boyishly exuberant
communication. This ran: “Sorry—circumstances
make it impossible for me to accept
your splendid, kindly offer—hope at some
future date—”</p>

<p class='c008'>The clumsy old sliding doors to his barn-hangar
were rammed shut, and left shut.
Within were the remains of his greatest wind
bird. The torn cloth and tangled wires were
left undisturbed in their huddled dump. Hal
didn’t even bother to see what parts were
good enough to be rejuvenated into some
other variety of gliding apparatus. He just
ceased to experiment.</p>

<p class='c008'>He repaired the old truck instead. He went
after hauling business. Several times a week
he made double trips to Interborough. Once
he made three trips—a haul that worked him
twenty-three hours out of the twenty-four.
He wanted to work, so that he would be too
tired even to think.</p>

<p class='c008'>Summer passed into autumn.</p>

<p class='c008'>One day when Hal rattled into the paved
streets of Interborough with a towering combination
load of cowhides, lightwood bundles
and great blackened sacks of country-burned
charcoal, he found himself in the midst of
carnival.</p>

<p class='c008'>Autumn was a period of street fairs. One
had strung its booths of shooting galleries,
side shows and outdoor aerial trapezes along
a roped-off concession on one of the city’s side
streets. Even this early in the morning, flags
and banners flaunted themselves in a chipper
gayness. Small dark-skinned people, with a
gypsyish, foreign look, busied themselves with
settling tent-pins, tautening ropes, setting out
their tinsel wares,—calling out now and then
in soft, slurring accent.</p>

<p class='c008'>They might be a travel-grimed lot, these
gaudy-costumed traders in tinseled junk and
these bandy-legged acrobats. But they had
been somewhere, were going somewhere.
They caught Hal’s imagination, stirred it out
of its long, dull dormancy. After he had
halted some minutes, while his eyes caught
the glint of sunlight on tent tops and fluttering
little banners, he shot the juice to the old
truck and, stiffening his backbone behind the
wheel, rattled off down the street actually
whistling. Out across town in an old field behind
the warehouse, where he went to deliver
the roll of cowhides, Hal’s eye glimpsed something
roped down to fence posts and a couple
of stakes. A something that sent his heart
blood pounding suffocatingly up to his very
ears,—an airplane! A battered affair, with
the look of having ridden the winds full many
a time! But an airplane, for all that.</p>

<p class='c008'>All the air hunger that Hal had been crushing
out of his soul for months surged up, took
possession of him overwhelmingly. Leaving
his truck standing in the sandy street, he slid
down, was over the fence, stood near this air
thing roped down against any chance windstorm.
For all its lack of paint, the old bus
had good points. It was shaped for speed, its
wings gave a sense of balance, proportion too.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal walked round and round it, hands
thrust down into his pockets. He made no
attempt to touch it. He knew from his own
experience how one hated having outsiders
mauling and prodding at one’s contrivances.
But just standing close, merely looking gave
him more pleasure than he had known for
most of the past summer. He was so absorbed
in contemplation of wires and struts and
curve-twist of propeller that he was hardly
aware of a knot of men coming down the field
towards him. They came in a close-packed
group, talking loudly, gesticulating—evidently
in heated argument over something.
Words shot up like explosives. Snatches of
sentences beat into Hal’s consciousness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But man, you got to—in the contract,
flying—stunting—parachuting—everything—”
A fat man waved his arms in windmill accompaniment
to his argument.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know—I know all that,” a slender dark
fellow with black eyes and a boldly aquiline
nose above a square chin interrupted quietly.
“I’m willing to fly, I’m willing to stunt. But I
gotter have help. I can’t sail a bus and
parachute drop from it all at the same time—not
without crashing my bus, and I ain’t going
to do that for any fifty dollars a day. Ain’t
my fault. How’d I know old Boff was going
to get sick and quit on me for keeps?” The
speaker rammed a hand into his pocket. “Say,
wait, I’ll do the right thing. You can cancel
the whole thing. I’ll hand you back the dough
you paid for yesterday’s work—that’ll even
up—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, keep the money,” a heavy-set fellow
said. “It’s not the money that’s worrying us.
It’s the advertisement business. The city’s
paying for the stunts—Trade-in-Interborough
Campaign and all that, you know—got posters
plastered over the county, newspapers
been tooting it up—if we don’t give ’em the
thrills we been promising, our country customers
pouring in here have got a right to be
sore at us. Say, don’t you know anybody
round about you can pick up to stunt?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No-o,” the dark fellow shook his head and
walked restlessly around the plane, laying a
hand affectionately on it here and there.
“Boff and I’ve been out west mostly, don’t
know any outfits down this way. Sa-a-ay, you
get me a man! In a pinch like this, I’ll do well
by him, give him half the dough.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Half the dough, half of fifty dollars—that
would be twenty-five dollars! A madness,
evoked perhaps by his sudden contact once
more with airmen and airplanes, stirred Hal
Dane clear out of himself. Hardly conscious
that it was he, Hal Dane, who was doing this
fantastic thing, he walked straight into the
group.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll take him up on that,” he said firmly.
“I’ll stunt with him!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Umph—eh! You’ve got the nerve, you
sound sporting,” the flyer whirled and looked
him straight up and down. “But no, you’re
just a youngster. What would folks say if I
let you go up and something happened to us—no,
no!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m six feet of man, and make my own living—and
I can’t help being young,” said Hal
whimsically. Then his grin faded and his
face set. Now that this fantastic chance was
slipping away, he wanted it desperately.
“Give me the chance,” he pleaded. “There’s
not a dizzy bone in me, and I’ve got some idea
of balance—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look who it is! That’s right what he’s
telling you, he’s got—what you call it—wing
sense.” Like a small chipper tornado, Harry
Nevin, newspaperman, ploughed up from the
rear of the group. “Hey, don’t you folks remember?
This is the kid that got his picture
in the Star! Went up with Raynor and
brought down Raynor’s machine for him, and
all that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, so you know about flying, and running
sky busses,” stated the aviator with relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know about flying—but, well, not so much
about real planes,” admitted Hal, honestly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s sailed all over the country on a glider
he made himself,” broke in the reporter. “He
knows more about balance in a minute than
most—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have it your own way,” burst out the
aviator irritably. “Since you’re all so set on
letting this kid do your stunting, I’ll take him
up. But the responsibility’s on your heads,
not mine. And say, you all better clear out
and let us get to work. He ain’t got but an
hour to be taught all there is to this here
stunting business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>While the crowd was departing, some over,
some crawling under the three-strand wire
fence, the aviator busied himself with peering
into the vitals of his ship. Soon though, he
raised up, and stalked over to the boy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m Maben, Max Maben,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m Hal Dane.” The boy stuck out his
hand and the older man grasped it in a quick
strong motion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, what makes you willing to go up in a
strange plane, with a strange flyer, and tackle
a lot of stuff you don’t know anything about?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Got it in the blood, I reckon, this being
crazy about wanting to get mixed up in anything
that’ll keep me near an airship,”
mumbled Hal. “Anyway, I’d been studying
your plane. It looked right to me; I liked its
jib,” Hal grinned. “Then you came along,
and I—well, I reckon I liked your jib, too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Guess we’re going to get on.” And Maben
grinned back.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c009'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br />ON THE WING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Hal Dane’s blond head was in a whirl. In
sixty brief minutes Maben had tried to cram
into his cranium all the vast maze of desperately
important facts that one needs must
master prior to stunting and parachuting.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were up in the air now, zooming over
the city. Young Dane had on his first real
flying suit. He leaned back awkwardly
against the pack of his parachute. He had
never had on one of the things before. There
was something else new, the speaking tube
with earpieces that fitted up under the helmet.
Maben was talking through it now.</p>

<p class='c008'>“City looks pretty down there—trees and
houses all flattened out like pictures on a rug.
I’ll circle you over the Fairgrounds next, so
you can see the clear space you’re to come
down in. Got a mob to watch us, ain’t we?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal felt grateful to Maben. He knew all
this kindly rambling talk was indulged in to
keep a raw new amateur stunter’s mind off
the coming crisis.</p>

<p class='c008'>Above them the sky was bright and beautiful;
scarcely a cloud flecked it. Below them
little black dots milled around in every direction.
That would be the crowd swarming out
to enjoy the vicarious thrill of seeing someone
else in the air. There were tiny waving
threads that must be flags, and a decorated
stand where a band was probably blaring.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Feel your strap—good and tight—for
sure?” Maben’s voice rumbled to him. “Got
to do my part of the stunting now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There came a sudden change in the behavior
of the plane. Instead of straight flying,
Maben began to put it through an intricate
series of stunts. He went into nose spins, tail
spins, falling leaves, and loop the loops. It
was a breath-taking exhibit, at times seemingly
reckless beyond all warrant. Yet there
was never a slip nor careen to the ship. For
perhaps half an hour this continued, then
the plane straightened out in a long graceful
glide.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your time next, kid,” muttered Maben,
“and for Scott’s sake, hold on and be careful.
Don’t try to give ’em too much for their
money.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal pulled the earpieces of the speaking
tube from under his helmet and climbed out
of the cockpit.</p>

<p class='c008'>He stood on the lower wing surface, holding
on by a strut, waiting. Over his left
shoulder he had a glimpse of the pilot’s
strained face.</p>

<p class='c008'>Maben was circling the plane lower and
lower, flying just above the trees and the
grandstand to catch the eye of the crowd.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ready, go! It was the time. Hal, clinging
to the strut, poised to walk out on that wing
piece of fragile wood strips and cloth, had the
ghastly feeling that his heart had stopped
beating. Then its pounding sent the blood
roaring to his ears.</p>

<p class='c008'>No treat, this wing walking business! Suppose
the pilot shoved the stick or jazzed the
engine!</p>

<p class='c008'>But Max Maben held his speed to a level;
no dropping, no high-riding. Nice work! The
ship steady on all axes, calm as a rocking
chair in a parlor!</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal’s terror wave passed. He stood free of
the strut, walked, bowed, cut a step or two.
With a man like Maben at the stick to hold
her steady, this was nothing. No more than
walking the boards of some earth-bound floor.
All you had to do was to keep your mind on
your feet, and not look over the edge. Through
Hal shot a sudden daring desire to climb a
strut to the top wing of the biplane, to stand
there erect, outlined against the sky. He
gripped a support preparatory to a climb.</p>

<p class='c008'>Maben’s signal stopped him. It came
sharply, the signal they had arranged upon,
two quick taps on the fuselage. Hal turned.
The pilot was glaring at him from under
fiercely drawn brows, and his mouth was in
a set line. Swiftly Maben gave the next signal,
three taps. That meant the ship was going
to climb for altitude for the parachute
jump.</p>

<p class='c008'>The altimeter began to mark up—fifteen
hundred, eighteen hundred, two thousand.
Maben made a level movement with one hand.
That meant all was ready. In slow reversements,
Maben held the ship over the center of
the field below.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go!” tapped the four beats of the signal.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal was out on the wing tip. He made a
movement towards space, froze back into a
crouch and felt frenziedly back at his parachute.
Suppose it were not there! Suppose
he had never put it on! His fingers touched
the compact bulk of the ’chute that dangled
gawkily from shoulder straps and belt straps.
Hal braced himself, shamed at his childishness.
No more fooling. He must go this time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Steady, go!</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal Dane stepped off the wing edge and
dropped into space.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pull-off swung him like a toy. Everything
went black. He shut his eyes, opened
them again. The earth seemed to gyrate below
him. Above him, the zoom of the ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>He must pull the rip cord of the ’chute. No,
no—not yet! Must wait, must be no danger
of tearing silken fabric against a whirl of the
plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>Down, down. Top speed. Heart in throat.
Ghastly shriek of air in his face. His head
was going down. He must kick, keep the
slant. Maben had said, “Keep your head up—head
down gives you one bustin’ yank in the
middle when she opens up!”</p>

<p class='c008'>One, two, four, six,—twenty—no use to
count heartbeats—heart must have thumped
a thousand times by now. No time to waste.
Earth looked like it was coming up. Now!
Now! He must pull the rip cord!</p>

<p class='c008'>Down, down. The thing hadn’t opened!
Suppose—</p>

<p class='c008'>The great silk lobe opened out with a
“pow-a” like a cannon shot.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lightning speed drop was checked suddenly,
and the parachute harness tightened
about him at the pull. He seemed to drop no
more. He felt that he was only floating, a
mere dot against the immensity of the skies.
He seemed an unreality, a swaying atom drifting
in the gulfs of space. The earth that a
moment ago had seemed coming up to meet
him now seemed a thousand miles away.
Would he ever come down, touch foot on that
earth again?</p>

<p class='c008'>As the great inverted chalice of the silken
parachute ceased its oscillations, the earth
also ceased its tremendous rise and fall. It
seemed to stand steady below Hal Dane, and
he was approaching it faster than he had
thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boy suddenly remembered to cross his
legs (Max Maben’s orders), lest he straddle a
telephone wire, a church steeple or something
equally disastrous.</p>

<p class='c008'>A feeling of terrible helplessness was upon
him. Nothing that he could do could change
his direction. The wind could do that though.
A sudden gust could blow him out over water,
ram him against a stone building, hurl him
before a rushing train.</p>

<p class='c008'>But no wind arose. He was coming straight
down. The crowd below seemed scattering to
give him room. He looked up, saw Maben
climbing down from the skies to meet him.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the field, men were running forward to
catch his heels as he touched earth. Many
hands helped him hold down against the tug
of the parachute, while he worked at the clips
of the harness. As the straps fell away and
he stepped free, Maben landed and taxied towards
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Kid, you did it!” Maben’s brown hands
gripped his shoulder and turned him about to
face the applause of the crowd that had gone
crazy with clapping and shouting. Swept
away by relaxation of the tense excitement,
those near him pounded him, tried to hoist
him on shoulders for a parade.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Hal’s first taste of glory. It thrilled
him, but he soon longed to get away from it
all. As soon as he could he ducked and
escaped and followed in the direction of
Maben, whom he had seen trundling the plane
into seclusion behind the grandstand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say!” Maben turned on him in mock fierceness,
“I’m of a mind to kick you for overstunting
on that plane wing. No use being
too risky—just plain foolishness, that. But,
kid,” the aviator’s habitually tense face relaxed
into a boyish grin. “I’ll say you made
that come down O.&nbsp;K.,—all jake! An old-timer
couldn’t have done it prettier. Listen,
I got a proposition I want to make you!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c009'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br />A ONE-SHIP CARNIVAL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Hi, sleepy-head, don’t you ever get up of
a morning? Going to snooze all day?” A
couple of resounding smacks against the hammock
he swung in startled Hal into semi-wakefulness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Um-m, yes,” hammock shaking to violent
stretchings of its human burden. “Gosh,
seems like just a minute since I crawled in.
Didn’t night pass in a hurry?” Hal stuck a
tousled blond head out of his sleeping bag and
gazed reproachfully down at Maben, who was
already up and, in spite of the crisp autumn
chill, was taking a shower bath by the simple
expedient of standing in the shallow creek and
flinging water all over himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a strange camping outfit that Maben
and Hal had evolved. Instead of a tent, they
utilized the upper wing of Maben’s old biplane
as a roof over their heads. They had constructed
hammocks of heavy canvas which
could be suspended, one on each side of the
fuselage, up under the top wing. The corners
of a hammock were tied to the upper strut fittings,
and when a fellow crawled into the
three blankets inside, which were sewn up to
form a bag, he was prepared for a comfortable
night.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sliding out carefully, so as not to wreck the
wing fabric above and below him in any way,
Hal stood up, stretched again, then made a
speedy dash for a dip in the creek and a leap
into clothes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My time to cook! I’ll get breakfast to pay
for oversleeping,” shouted Hal, back at the
plane and grabbling into the little provision
sack tucked under canvas in the cockpit.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sack contained little enough in the way
of foodstuff—some potatoes, a little bacon,
nubbin of bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Hal flopped over the sizzle of meat and
spuds in the frying-pan and set out the meal
in two tin plates, he attended to the job by
mere mechanical touch,—his mind was running
round in circles. What in the dickens
were they going to do? If they spent what
little they had buying food, there’d be no
money to buy gas. If they bought gas,—no
food! Um, better draw their belts tighter and
put the cash in gas. No gas meant no stunt
flying—no stunt flying, no crowd to take for
rides. And carrying passengers was how
they earned their living.</p>

<p class='c008'>Three states lay between Hal and home.</p>

<p class='c008'>Maben’s proposition had been a wild one—that
he and Hal join forces and stunt together
over the backwoods country towns. It would
be a precarious livelihood. Some days they
might cop nothing. Some days they might
make a pile. Maben needed a “pile” for his
folks back home, his wife, a baby boy, a little
daughter just old enough to start school.
Maben carried their pictures in a rubbed old
case stuck away in an inside pocket. Hal had
his home folks on his heart too. He needed to
earn money somehow. Even though the mere
touch of a plane and the call of the air were a
delightful lure, he knew aero-stunting was a
risky business. In the end he had decided to
tackle it, for a while anyway. So he had
rattled the old truck home from Interborough,
turned over to his mother the first twenty-five
dollars he had ever earned all in a lump, and
had joined Maben.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a while they had made good money. In
sections where airplanes had never come or at
most had been merely glimpsed—a swift moving
speck in the sky that came out of nowhere
and disappeared into nowhere—a plane that
really came down to earth was a novelty. As
they flew over villages, folks rushed out into
the open, heads thrown back, eyes on the sky,
arms waving and beckoning excitedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>After circling to find a good pasture or
stubble field from which to operate (a piece
of open ground close up to the village being
of course most desirable from a showman’s
point of view), Maben would fly low, and Hal
would begin to do wing-walking. If the sight
of a young fellow walking and cavorting and
skinning-the-cat between wire struts on the
wing of a flying plane didn’t catch the eye of
the crowd, the parachute drop could always be
counted on to “get ’em going.” After the
stunts, Maben would fly low and ease to a
perfect landing to show folks how safe it was
to come down in an airplane.</p>

<p class='c008'>After landing, there would always be a
heavy barrage of questions—were the wings
made of tin or catgut; what was that paddle
thing in front; which was worse, to break the
nose or the tail; how did it feel to fly, anyway?
The answer was that the only way to know
how it felt to fly was to try it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Because a plane was an expensive machine
and because it took considerable funds to buy
gasoline, the charge for a short sky-ride had
to be five dollars.</p>

<p class='c008'>After one brave native son took his courage
in his hands and went up for a flight, others
usually crowded in, anxious for their share of
the thrills. Once a whole village, out on the
gala event of an annual picnic, “took to the
air.” That night Maben and Hal found they
had taken in a hundred and seventy-five dollars.
The nickels and dimes and small bills,
emptied out of a bulging canvas sack into the
dip of a hammock, looked like a young mountain
of money. Hal and Maben both had fat
checks to send home that week.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal had enjoyed visualizing how his mother
and Uncle Tel looked when they received his
check, liked to picture the comforts in which
they could now indulge.</p>

<p class='c008'>But out here on the edge of Texas business
had flopped. They seemed to have struck a
belt where planes had become common as dirt,
no rarity at all. Other barnstormers must
have combed this section well ahead of them.
When Hal and Maben zoomed over villages,
nobody even bothered to look up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve got to make ’em look,” said Maben
fiercely, as he mopped the last crumb out of
his tin plate, “got to make ’em look—or we
don’t eat. I’ve got sort of a plan.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When he and Hal walked into town to see
about having a tank of gasoline sent out to the
plane, Maben dropped hints everywhere about
a thriller of a high dive they were going to
stage, a high dive into the whirlpool below the
falls of Faben River, just out of town. Folks
that wanted their hair to stand on end better
not miss that! Plenty of excitement!</p>

<p class='c008'>Back at their camp, Maben, chuckling like
the big boy he was at heart, worked all the
rest of the morning on a contraption made of
empty cloth sacks on which he sewed valiantly
with a huge needle threaded with stout string.
He made four bolster-shaped rolls, a square
pillow, a rounded knob, all of them stuffed
with dead grass and some mixed sand and clay
thrown in for good weight. Then he assembled
his six parts, sewed them strongly
together into the form of a stiff, stubby
dummy man.</p>

<p class='c008'>That afternoon when Hal and Maben went
up in the plane, the dummy man went with
them, scrouged down out of sight in the cockpit.
Low over the houses and trees flew
Maben, with Hal out on a wing tip doing all
the stunts he knew. With that air balance
that seemed born in him, Hal bowed and
whirled on the lower wing, did acrobatics between
struts, climbed to the top wing, stood
outlined against the sky in daring silhouette.
From his swift-moving aerial stage, the boy
shouted down for the crowd to gather at the
river bank—last stunt to be pulled there—a
thriller!</p>

<p class='c008'>Higher and higher over the foaming, rocky
rapids of the river and its whirlpool below the
falls rode the airplane. Flat on his stomach
on the lower plane wing, Hal lay stretched out,
holding to a wing strut with one hand and
reaching into the cockpit with the other. It
took every ounce of muscle in him to draw the
weighted dummy up, to flatten it on top of
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Maben was too high to allow a good aim at
the tiny blotch of water below. Good aim and
quick sinking of the dummy into the whirling
waters was the main part of the huge, thrilling
joke they were attempting to pull off.
Down from eighteen hundred feet to a thousand,
to eight hundred—five hundred. The
roar of the motor diminished. Max Maben
hovered over the pool center in slow reversements
and wing slips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quick, shoot him overboard!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Over the plane edge, down and down went
the dummy, waving its arms and legs wildly.
Hal felt a ridiculous sympathy for it, it looked
so human. Still flattened out and peering
warily over the wing, Hal saw it take water
in one splendid plunge into oblivion. He saw
people running up and down the bank, pointing,—he
was sure they were shouting, only no
voices came up to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>But instead of circling down, straightening
out for one of his beautiful easy landings in
even the small field that the river valley allowed,
Maben began to circle upward, always
in the same tight spirals.</p>

<p class='c008'>Going up now was poor business. Maben
ought to be easing down to take advantage of
the excited interest his little advertising stunt
had aroused.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal wriggled forward, stuck a head over to
see why Maben didn’t go down.</p>

<p class='c008'>Still circling, the pilot made motions, pointing
to the throttle. In a jiffy Hal whirled his
long legs around and slid into the cockpit. As
he bent close, Maben shouted in his ear:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gotter keep going! Throttle’s stuck!
Can’t shut the motor off!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c009'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />RIVER OF THE WIND</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Maben kept circling. Beside him, Hal
worked desperately, trying every known and
unknown device for loosing a stuck throttle.
But stuck she stayed.</p>

<p class='c008'>And the interminable circling kept on. It
seemed hours that they rode thus, using up
their precious gas in this ridiculous, passengerless
flight. Finally Hal crawled out of the
cockpit and crept to the front of the wing. He
risked thrusting a hand gingerly down in the
back of the engine. Finally his searching fingers
closed over the obstruction, a slick, bottle-shaped
thing with a greasy pointed neck. It
was their can of motor oil, carried for emergencies,
and it had jarred under the throttle-arm
and wedged. Hal tugged and pulled but
the grease-covered can seemed to offer no grip
for his fingers. He reached in for a closer
grasp, set his teeth, and yanked. The obstruction
gave, zipped out with such momentum
that the force of Hal’s pull nearly shot him
backwards off the plane edge. The can spun
a thousand feet down through space. Rather
white around the mouth, Hal slid back into
the safety of the pit.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a freed throttle, Maben made a landing
with all of his usual ease and grace. But
there was no one to watch him. The little
crowd that their ruse of the diving dummy
had assembled for them had long since departed.</p>

<p class='c008'>So far as barnstorming aviation was concerned,
East Texas seemed to be a total loss.
Hal and Maben swooped down to their camp,
gathered up their very limited assortment of
housekeeping necessities, and set wing for
further westward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Within the week they hit a line of carnivals
and country fairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>With so much competition in the way of
stunt flyers and aerial circuses, any newcomer
on the scene must think up something
out of the ordinary if he expected to make a
living with his sky bus. And with necessity
fostering invention, Hal’s brain conjured up
the something.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even on these little half-mile country tracks,
the auto racer was replacing the old-time
horse racer. Hal’s agile imagination leaped
a step further. Why not race car against airplane?
The one on the ground, the one in the
air, but both racing in the same limited circle
in full view of the grandstand?</p>

<p class='c008'>It was so revolutionary an idea that at first
no one would listen to him. A laugh in the
face was all he got for his explanations of how
to manage this new thrill-offering.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the manager of the lively carnival in
swing at Repton caught Hal’s vision. On his
track was staged their first auto-aero race.
There was a spice of danger to the thing—at
least for the aerial part of it. To speed a plane
in a little half-mile circuit takes a master hand
at the stick. But Maben had that master
hand. He could make a sky bus do almost
anything in reason.</p>

<p class='c008'>Above the tiny circuit of the dirt track he
had to bank his old plane pretty nearly straight
up and down and zoom around like a bee in a
bottle. To keep from winning too soon and
ruining the show, he had to throttle down her
motor until the last lap. Then he’d let the sky
bus out and show the boys what she could do.
Below him the begoggled auto speed-fiend
would let his ground ship out too and smoke
his wheels on turns, but the sky bus always
won.</p>

<p class='c008'>The auto-aero race was a success, a wow!
It caught the fancy of the crowds and gave
them more thrills than they knew were left in
this thrill-worn universe. The air-earth races
kept the Repton Fair open a week longer than
had been counted upon. After its closing, Hal
and Maben drifted on to other fairs and found
good money waiting for them almost everywhere
they touched. Sometimes they took in
twenty-five dollars a day, but more often it
was seventy-five, and now and again they
reached the hundred mark.</p>

<p class='c008'>At Zenner, Hal had the thrill of buying himself
a plane. It was an old J-1 Standard, the
type of ship the army used to train pilots before
the war. Its owner had made one flight
in it and had come down to a perfect one-point
landing—straight on the nose—and smashed
up everything.</p>

<p class='c008'>Max Maben knew points though when it
came to planes, and advised Hal to buy. They
made Zenner their headquarters for a while
and radiated out from it to do carnival flying.
Between times they worked on the plane.
In the end they evolved a patched-up creation
built with homemade spars, a second-hand
engine and rusty fittings that had to be
painted over. But she flew like a bird. The
carnival season was closing in. Hal used the
old J-l Standard to double their earnings by
flying races at one fair while Max filled his
schedule at other fairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>But for all her sweet flying, the Standard
wasn’t altogether a lucky plane. Some nemesis
of mischance seemed to dog her flights
more often than not. Once when the two
flyers had her out for a pleasure spin that took
them hedgehopping over mountain tops and
skimming the warm air softness of the desert
edge, the false darkness of a windstorm
swooped around them and sent them earthward
for a forced landing. In the dimness
they took to ground between the cactus and
Spanish dagger covering old fields. And here
they stayed the better part of a week. As
they landed, a villain of a Spanish dagger
plant had slashed through the front spar of
a wing. It took half a day to patch the ten-inch
gap in the spar and to sew up a dozen rips
in the wing fabric. It took half a week of
cutting sagebrush and cactus to clear enough
space for a take-off runway.</p>

<p class='c008'>But whether the old J-l Standard was a
lucky bird or not, possession of it began to
stir in Hal Dane a slow, subtle change. Ownership
of a plane of his own awoke in him vast
longings and hopes. In spare moments he was
always tinkering lovingly around the old bus,
seeing if a wire tightened here didn’t make
her wing edge better, or if a heavier wire coil
above the landing gear didn’t make her taxi
along sweet. Now and again when he had a
spell off from carnival work, he took the “J”
up on long, high solo flights.</p>

<p class='c008'>On one of these lonely air journeys he
pushed higher than ever before. The vast altitudes
were always luring the boy, held a
fascination for him. Zooming up into the
ether till from land he might seem some mere
speck in the sky had long since ceased to
awake in him any nervous terrors. Instead,
he reveled in the sense of space and freedom
the heights gave him. Aerial intuition
showed him that, within limits, the higher he
was, the safer he was. An engine break a
hundred feet above ground, where room for
soaring tactics was limited and the parachute
of no account, was a much more terrible danger
than a similar accident two miles high.
The heights meant safety from rough ground
air; ten or fifteen thousand feet often meant
safety from storms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Up and up Hal pushed his rough-built,
patched-winged old army relic, reveling wildly
in the freedom of the skies, fourteen, fifteen,
sixteen thousand feet up. Intense cold froze
him to the marrow, chattered his teeth. Air
pressure weighted his brain, reeled his head
dizzily. If only he had some protecting,
oxygen-piped helmet to protect him from air
heights, as a diver had helmet to save him
from water pressure! If—if! Then he could
explore the great unknown of the air! But
even at a puny sixteen-thousand-foot height,
the sky had revelations for one that soared
its spaces knowingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once in his high flying, Hal was swept into
the vast power of a great westward flowing
current of air. A veritable river of the wind.
It swept him on fast and faster. Exhilaration
shot through the boy’s being. Speed!
Power! Here was power waiting to be harnessed
by man. Westward on a river of the
wind!</p>

<p class='c008'>A thousand years ago his Norse ancestors
had swept westward on ocean currents, the
rivers of the sea, to find a new land. Some
day, he, Hal Dane must sweep westward on a
river of the wind to discover—what?</p>

<p class='c008'>He longed to fly onward forever as he was
now, with a speed wind under his wings. But
the cold was devouring him, the awesome
pressure was roaring into his brain. Anger
at his puny man’s impotence in the face of
such power shook him. He could bear no
more, the air weights were smothering him.
Downward he began to drop in long swoops.</p>

<p class='c008'>As altitude had plunged him into a baptism
of ice, so earth, as he swooped downward,
seemed to have prepared for him a baptism of
fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>Below him, in great gusts, yellow-edged
billows of black smoke clouds poured up. Funnels
of sparks blasted up on the winds and
scattered to shower back into an inferno of
flames.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal swerved aside, but sent his plane in a
huge circuit nearer earth, so that without danger
he could inform himself concerning this
disaster.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a barn in flames—the great red barn
of some lonely ranch place. Crammed as it
must be with hay and wheat shocks, it had
become a roaring furnace, spouting flames up
into the very skies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Disastrously near to the doomed barn was
the house. The little white farmhouse seemed
to crouch pitiably, seemed almost a human
thing, earth-bound and with fire-death sweeping
against it.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Hal circled nearer, he could see little
frantic specks that were human beings running
back and forth with futile buckets of
water. From experience out here, Hal had
come to know something of the water dearth
of the plains. What avail were the few hundred
gallons of water in a little cistern against
this raging fire monster?</p>

<p class='c008'>But the human specks fought on madly.
The barn was doomed. They were fighting
for the house. Up went the buckets of precious
water to wet down the roof. Now they
were spreading sopping blankets. And to
what use? The wind was veering more, the
sparks were showering continuously. For one
flaming shingle stamped out, two more leaped
into blaze.</p>

<p class='c008'>Like one fascinated by danger, Hal circled
nearer. It was madness. A spark on his wing,
curl of flame bursting out of the inflammable
lacquer pigment—then the death crash.</p>

<p class='c008'>But this little white house was somebody’s
home—his all!</p>

<p class='c008'>The boy flung caution from him. He
dropped low, aimed his plane straight out.
With a zoom of the mighty wind-makers of
his wings, he drove forward down the air lane
between the flaming hell of the barn and the
little crouching house in its imminent doom.</p>

<p class='c008'>In his wake swept vast air currents swirled
upward by the speed of his passage, a wind
wall that turned back spark and flames from
showering on the house roof.</p>

<p class='c008'>His own wings had dodged sparks somehow,
run the fire gauntlet unscathed this one time.
It was risking fate, but Hal Dane wheeled his
aircraft and shot again down the dangers of
that fire-fenced air lane.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal Dane was using his plane like a gigantic
fan to combat the fire’s spread. His very
speed must have shed the falling dangers of
sparks from his own wings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Full forty times he drove his ship back and
forth between the little house and the flaming
barn, making mighty air currents that turned
back the peril like a shield of the wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fire-riddled structure collapsed, shooting
flames enormously high, then settled into a
smouldering mass. This might burn on for
days, but its real menace to the farmhouse
was ended.</p>

<p class='c008'>With danger conquered, Hal Dane, like some
crusader of the air, whirled skyward, incognito.
Those he had saved would never know
who had saved them.</p>

<p class='c008'>But flame and danger had strangely stirred
the boy’s heart, had fired his ambition into a
steady glow that henceforth was to flinch at
nothing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Emotion—inspiration—a medley of feelings
surged up in him as he swirled high into the
sky. Higher, higher, back again into the
mighty rushing currents of the rivers of the
winds! To what did that current flow
westward? Some day he must explore it—must
know.</p>

<p class='c008'>High, and higher, till the air pressure sang
heavily against his brain. Here in the heights
the lure of still another adventure was calling
him—the adventure of invention. The world
was waiting for that—waiting for man to pit
his brain against the dangers of the great
ethereal upper strata. Man must conquer air
heights as he had conquered earth heights.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a new Hal Dane that came down from
this sky flight. He was no longer a boy, satisfied
with clowning above a carnival in an air
machine. In his mind burned a definite desire
to master aeronautics instead of merely drifting
aimlessly, satisfied to dabble in air flying.</p>

<p class='c008'>Along with ambition he had the hard common
sense to know that he must go back and
begin at the bottom, lay his foundations right
if he meant to climb high.</p>

<p class='c008'>That night he mailed a letter to the Rand-Elwin
Flying School. Days later the answer
came, stating that he could still have the work
and the tuition in that organization that he
had applied for once before. Hal was both
surprised and pleased to read that Rex Raynor
was now one of the flying instructors in
the school.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the chill of winter beginning to creep
over the great southern stretches of Texas,
the season of country fairs and carnivals came
to a close. Maben was anxious now to get
home for a short visit with his family. After
that he meant to try for some practical, year-around
work—the air mail, or forest ranger
air service. And Hal had his own ambitious
plans burning within him.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the Louisiana-Texas border town of Aldon,
he and Maben parted company. It was
a wrench for both of them. But then they
could cheer their hearts with the knowledge
that the science of flying was making the
world smaller every day. All through life, he
and Maben would likely enough be meeting at
various landing fields—to “ground fly” and
joke about their lurid carnival past.</p>

<p class='c008'>Barnstorming might have been the slap-stick life,
but both Hal and Maben could be
thankful for their period of buzzing a plane
above country fairs—their work had brought
them in enough money to keep their families
comfortable for some months to come.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal was also ahead an additional five hundred
from the sale of his old plane. He could
embark with an easy mind on what promised
to be the greatest adventure, so far, in his life.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c009'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />GROUND WORK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Before Hal Dane lay the great unknown—the
three thousand parts of a dissected D. C.
engine.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I’ve got to get ’em together,” he
moaned. “Gosh, was it to assort engine-hash
that I went through all I’ve stood lately?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal Dane had been on a strain, of a sort.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as he landed at the far-stretching,
smooth acres of the Rand-Elwin Field,
bounded by hangars, barracks, instruction
halls, he had passed the inspection of Mr.
Rand at the office, inspection of short, dark,
imperturbable Major Weston, primary instructor,
passed test-inspection for every ailment
in the world—or so it had seemed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal had to undergo examination for heart
action, and short-sightedness, and color blindness,
and sense of balance and equilibrium.
He was thumped and spun and eye-tested till
he began to imagine that he really must have
some outlandish physical defects. It came as
an exhilarating shock to him when the doctor
thumped him in the back and grunted,
“Umph,—prime condition,—fellow with a constitution
like that could fly to the moon!”</p>

<p class='c008'>So Hal was turned over to Major Weston
for training in the elementary principles of
flying.</p>

<p class='c008'>In relief at his acceptance, Hal’s hopes flew
high.</p>

<p class='c008'>But hopes were all that flew high. Hal Dane
in person was kept pretty low, smudging at a
lot of engine junk that didn’t look like it was
ever meant to fit together.</p>

<p class='c008'>To Instructor Weston aviation was neither
a sport nor an experiment. It was a business.
Under him a student was taught an aerial
groundwork as solid as a railroad rock bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Since the internal-combustion gasoline engine
was the accepted, standardized motor
power for aircraft flight, Major Weston saw
to it that his pupils knew internal-combustion
gasoline engines—else they didn’t graduate
into the next class.</p>

<p class='c008'>For Hal, the lessons seemed to go on interminably
about the valve, the piston, ignition,
spark, carburetor. He endured all the miseries
of a brilliant pianist given to performing
by “ear” who is set down in a primer class to
learn note reading and scales. He began to
feel that the outside of the ship, wing beauty,
pull of propeller, soaring power, were what
had fascinated him—not greasy, grimy intricacies
of engines. In fact, heretofore engines
had not entered very much into his
aerial plans. He had known how to crank
them, and fly them, and that had seemed
enough.</p>

<p class='c008'>But at Rand-Elwin, engines loomed large.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had been here for weeks, and so far had
not been allowed even the feel of a ship—except
the Puddle Duck, and one couldn’t call
that a ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Puddle Duck was an atrocity. It was
a stubby, short-winged boat with no more
grace of movement than the land-waddle of
that barnyard fowl for which it had been
named. The chunky plane, for all its ridiculous
wing effect, was merely a land ship. In
it, pupils studying balance taxied madly across
the turf, striving to keep its misshapen body
at proper angle—an impossibility. How
could one keep such an unbalanced blob balanced?</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal could have shed buckets full of tears
over his efforts at the joy stick of the Puddle
Duck. He who had flown real ships tied to this
thing!</p>

<p class='c008'>A huge surprise to young Dane was the finding
of Fuz McGinnis as an upper-classman
here. There had been no chance for writing
or receiving letters in the past months of Hal’s
track-hopping at various country fairs. Circumstances
had forced him out of touch with
Old Fuz and the rest of the home gang. And
now here was McGinnis grades ahead of him,
doing flights in a late model sky ship while
he wrestled with the Puddle Duck.</p>

<p class='c008'>He and Fuz eagerly fell back into the old
jolly comradeship in the little time school
duties allowed.</p>

<p class='c008'>For Hal, time seemed forever filled with
motors,—motors in sections, motors in mixed
masses waiting for him to learn their functions
and to reassemble their anatomies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Only gritted teeth and the sputtering flicker
of his river of the wind ambition held him to
his bewildering task day after day. He
thought he hated motors.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then in a blinding flash of understanding,
he began to “see” engines, to grasp their mechanical
beauty.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the marvel of the piston that first got
him. He began to sense something of the
power of that driving force that man has
learned to harness. It had taken man thousands
of years to learn to explode a mixture
of gasoline vapor and air in an engine’s cylinder
where a piston caught the force to hurl
forward power in a four-stroke cycle. That
four-stroke cycle could speed an automobile
over the highway or a wind ship over the airways.</p>

<p class='c008'>And he, Hal Dane, had fretted at giving a
few weeks to study this master power! Realization
came to him of how primitive were all
his notions of aircraft as compared with the
perfection man had already reached. Into
the building of one airship had to go the
knowledge of more than half a hundred crafts
and trades.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of mere rods and tubes of metal,
Hal now saw pistons and cylinders as power-containers.
To help his understanding, he
visualized how a pinch of gunpowder can easily
be put into a gun cartridge. But when the
powder is exploded it expands into gases that
would fill a house. It is the expansion that
shoots the bullet. So it was that the air-gas
mixture exploded in a cylinder rushed out to
force the piston into unbelievable speed. This
speed harnessed to gear and camshaft was the
power that was hurling the motor world forward—first
on wheels, now on wings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal forgot grease and grime in the sheer
wonder of mechanism. Those black engines
of iron, steel, aluminum and alloy became
beautiful—more beautiful than the spread
wings that had once fascinated him entirely.
For motors gave power to those wings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of hastening from ground work
into flying, as he could have done, Hal went
back into classes for a second course in engine
work.</p>

<p class='c008'>Because Hal showed promise, Major Weston
laid the work on him, uncompromisingly
made him dig for what he got. But after class
hours, a friendship sprang up between the
blond boy and the short, heavy-set pilot
trainer. Engines were their meat!</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal was beginning to master the intricacies
of motors, from the old seven thousand part
Spano Motor down through its more modern
descendant, the three thousand part D. C.
Motor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Engine mechanism was marvelous, was complicated—too
complicated. Even after he
understood the wondrous power and pull in
unison of the D. C., Hal’s brain rebelled somewhat
at the involvement of even this latest
build of motors. Man was smart to have made
so complicated a thing—but man would have
been more of a marvel to have made a simple
thing that would perform the same work.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But,” questioned Hal of his instructor-friend,
“for the air motor, every ounce of
weight removed means power saved; now
what—what could be taken from such an engine,
and still leave efficiency?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what? But why?”</p>

<p class='c008'>In their after-school confabs, Weston’s experience
and Hal’s theory and hopes fought
many an acrimonious friendly battle. Raynor,
who as advanced-flying pilot was for the
present out of Hal’s school sector, sometimes
of a night joined in these air battles fought
out on the ground. All manner of past and
modern experiments came under the fire
of their discussions. Aeronautical engine
builders seemed to have tried out many varieties
of motors. There were the long ago
experiments with steam engines for airplanes.
The engine itself could be made much lighter
than the gasoline engine, but the fuel and
water added so much weight that the whole
combination was far too heavy for air purposes.
Mercury and other liquids were tried
out without much success. Then came gasoline
and mercury-vapor turbines, fine in principle
but somehow unsuccessful. There was
a flaw that needed some genius to find it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The turbine principle is the coming
change,” argued Weston. “If the turbine
principle could be applied to an aeronautical
engine, it would eradicate many of the present
troubles.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But engine makers can’t seem to apply it,”
contended Hal. “Seems to me,” he hazarded
his next thought gingerly, “that the engine
without batteries is going to be the thing.
Batteries weigh an awful lot. How about this
high-degree compressed fuel and the way it
explodes under pressure in the cylinder—without
the ordinary explosion by electric
spark? That would cut out batteries and save
weight—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Save battery weight, yes!” countered Weston
out of his deeper knowledge, “but how
about the five hundred pound pressure to the
square inch needed to explode such engine
fuel?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And so the arguments ran on. But for all
the seeming impracticability, Hal’s mind was
focused on the experiments with the new type
engine with which certain inventors were
struggling. It appeared to the boy so much
simpler and safer an engine, with its few
parts, its more flying hours per given weight
of fuel. Not now, but some day—perhaps.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fuz McGinnis was specializing in wings,
not engines. Engines as they were suited him
well enough. Quite often though he came in
to take silent part in these nightly symposiums
held over the ills and blessings of motors. He
sat in the discussion for love of the companionship
of this oddly assorted trio of thinkers.</p>

<p class='c008'>As spring came on, Hal went from ground
work back again into air flight. He found the
routine of flying tests easy, because the inner
workings of engine mechanics seemed etched
on his very brain. The feel of wings stirred
him, roused all the old wild exhilaration of
flight. And yet he was more critical of air
machinery than in the past. Where before he
had been vastly satisfied with the mechanisms
of man-flight, he now caught himself wondering
continually why man had not made his
machines the better to withstand certain
shocks that were bound to come in any flying
routine. Flying gear had made progress, but
landing gear was still crude, still based on
land-moving machinery, instead of machinery
of the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pondering these things, Hal found his mind
working back to the piston-and-cylinder that
gave engines their power, their thrust. Why
couldn’t this same piston-and-cylinder principle
be used to lessen power for a landing
gear? His thoughts hung to this strange idea,
revolved the thing continually in his mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then one night he set before Weston and
Raynor his ponderings and plans.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s the crack and crash of quick landings
that break up so many planes.” The boy
spread his ideas gingerly before these two experienced
old heads, fearing the laugh over
some ridiculous flaw that his reasoning might
have passed up. “Seems to me man hasn’t got
so far in what he lands on! Oh, of course he’s
gone a little way, passed from a sled base to
wheels, then made the wheels larger and put
pneumatic tires on ’em! But at that, any
kind of speed landing bangs a fellow with a
recoil like a rammed cannon. Now suppose
between the ship and the landing gear we had
a new kind of shock absorbers—sort of buffers
made up of long cylinders with pistons in
them, containing oil or glycerine, or some fluid
like that, wouldn’t they—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hum—say—yes—”</p>

<p class='c008'>Raynor and Weston were leaning forward,
all absorbed in following this young fellow’s
reasoning, this radical plunge into something
far out of the ordinary rounds of mechanisms.
One piston-and-cylinder principle had been
harnessed to a gasoline vapor explosion to
hurl a motor forward. Now here was this
fellow’s futuristic brain seeing another piston-and-cylinder
principle harnessed in oil or glycerin
to gentle power and ease a speed plane to
the ground in a shockless landing!</p>

<p class='c008'>Long into the night the three of them discussed
the idea from all angles. It was his
friends’ advice that he keep his plans to himself—for
a while anyway. Then if the right
backing ever came along, something worth
while might be developed out of the thing.
Any dabblings in invention needed money to
back them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Out on the field, Hal went from week to
week through the different grades of flying.
Although he had done a deal of actual flying
before he ever entered the school, the precise,
thorough routine training of the Rand-Elwin
took no account of this. With flight, as with
engine study, he was made to start at the bottom
and was then given the “whole works.”
He had to begin with learning the controls,
pass from that to their application, then to
straight and even flying, climbs, banks.</p>

<p class='c008'>One day out on the flying field, Hal stood,
neck cracked back, eyes glued to the sky,
watching a plane that seemed to have gone
mad in the heights. He was sure it was Raynor.
He had seen Raynor take off just before.
Must be his ship. Yet he had never seen Raynor
double-daring death like that before.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c009'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br />SAFETY AND DANGER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Far above Hal Dane, Raynor’s airplane shot
into a fantastic rolling and twisting and turning,
falling like a withered leaf, springing to
life and hurling upward, stalling at wrong
angles, behaving like some crazed thing of
the skies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Raynor volplaned to a beautiful landing,
taxied across the turf, got out and strolled
over to Hal.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now you go up and take a try at that,” he
ordered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Umph—I mean, sir—oh, sure!” muttered
Hal, backing off a little and looking amazed.
Had the careful, conservative Raynor gone
out of his head?</p>

<p class='c008'>“I mean it,” said Raynor. Then his eyes
began to twinkle. “It’s all in the course. Only
you’re not to do it all by yourself the first few
dozen times. You’ll go up with me till you get
the hang of it from watching.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Signaling for mechanics to take charge of
his ship to give it the regular cleaning and
overhauling after flights, he led the way
towards the hangars for another machine.</p>

<p class='c008'>As they walked, Raynor launched into his
explanation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If a man wants to fly conservatively, he’s
first got to learn to stunt. May sound crazy,
but it’s a tested truth. It’s a known fact now
that a fourth of all the real crashes happen
because a fellow got into a tail spin and didn’t
know how to get out of it. And the pilots in
these crashes are mostly the youngsters, not
the veterans. When a flyer has lived long
enough with aviation to be considered a veteran,
he usually knows by instinct what to do
in a spin, doesn’t have to stop and think ‘What
button shall I push?’</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aviation school has caught the idea now
that it’s a pretty good thing to send a pupil
up with an old-timer who can put a bus into
spins and take it out of spins. If the pupil
watches close enough, he automatically learns
the movements. It’s the latest aviation insurance
against a crash!”</p>

<p class='c008'>A plane had been rolled out and warmed up.
They climbed in. Raynor ran quick fingers
along the straps that bound them both to their
seats, making certain that all was secure, then
he gave the word for the blocks to be knocked
away from in front of the machine.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a roar of the motor they were off,
speeding up at an angle that soon had them a
thousand feet above earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal Dane felt a catch of pure excitement in
his breath. This was going to be different
from any flying he had ever known. Heretofore
it had been “keep up speed, avoid stalls,
and thus avoid the fatal spin.” Now Raynor
was deliberately taking him into the danger
of stall and spin! Raynor was deliberately
taking him into the dangers he might incur if
fog, sleet or rain caught him, if unknown
mountains loomed suddenly ahead, if storm
winds hurled him out of balance.</p>

<p class='c008'>They rode higher still; then the pilot suddenly
shot sickeningly into the Chandelle, that
zooming, sharply-banked turnabout.</p>

<p class='c008'>He went into nose spins, and came out.
Went into tail spins, and came out.</p>

<p class='c008'>He took Hal through side-drifts and grapevines
and the fluttering leaf, then righted the
ship while one held the breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>Raynor took the ship high again, then dived.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next instant Hal was hanging by his
middle from the safety belt, while the ship
careened across the landscape absolutely upside
down. Earth and sky swung round. To
one hanging thus in dizzy space, the green
earth suddenly looked crushingly hard.</p>

<p class='c008'>The earth was coming up to meet them. It
could not be three hundred—no, not two hundred
feet distant. It was the end. Raynor had
gone too far—lost control—he must have—</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal steeled his nerves to try to meet the
crash without a shriek.</p>

<p class='c008'>But even while he held his breath to a sobbing
gasp, the ship rolled over slowly and
easily into normal flying position, and came to
earth with all the grace of a perfect three-point
landing.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rolling earth ceased rolling. Hal Dane
sat in a limp daze, like one come back from
beyond a veiled, blank interim. Then his
senses swept back to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>So Raynor had known what he was about all
the time. It was no accident. Knowingly he
had gone into the back-dive and come out with
the famous slow roll.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two weeks after that Hal Dane was doing
his own slow rolls, doing his spins and his Immelmanns.
He practiced continually, with
Raynor coaching him. High over a safe landing
field, the pilot showed him all sorts of
tricks and dodges, showed him how to extricate
his ship from every conceivable position.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here was carefulness in a new form. The
Rand-Elwin School tried to look ahead, to
foresee dangers, then to train its flyers to
meet that danger capably.</p>

<p class='c008'>Storm, fog, ice-weighted wings—these were
natural adversities that aviators must circumvent
as best they might.</p>

<p class='c008'>But there was still one worse danger—the
danger of carelessness.</p>

<p class='c008'>The instructors strove to teach air-minded
youngsters the arts of mechanical safety. In
the air courses it was a cause for demerit, for
expulsion from school even, for a pupil to fall
into some mechanical danger that forethought
could have avoided.</p>

<p class='c008'>A horrible event impressed forever into Hal
Dane’s mind the penalty one paid for mechanical
carelessness.</p>

<p class='c008'>At mid-day, one of the students in advanced
flying had gone up to give an exhibition in reverse
controls, turns and spirals.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was a marvelous flyer in spite of a certain
bland recklessness that seemed to edge
his every act. Now in the air he seemed to
short-turn in his spirals, to be given to shooting
into perilous climbs. He was that way in
all his work, sliding through with a swagger
carelessness. As he watched the pupil aviator
now in the air, Hal’s mind went back to events
of that very morning, how the fellow had gone
slipshod through the tiresome routine of
overhauling the engine of the machine he was
to use in the noon flight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some god of luck must ride that fellow’s
shoulder. For here he was up, flying a dirty
motor that would have clogged on anybody
else, yet gliding through dives and figure
eights with the easy grace of a whirlwind.</p>

<p class='c008'>A score of pupils and an instructor or two
stood on the field below, heads bent back,
watching the beautiful stalls and spins. Again
he shot high into the air in a circling swoop.
Then while everyone stared aloft, a little puff
of flame darted out from the engine.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It has back-fired—hot carbon showering
from that dirty engine!” moaned Hal between
white lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a dazed second everyone stood paralyzed
with horror while above them another
flame shot out, darting towards the carburetor.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next second the aviation field came
alive. Rex Raynor leaped to a machine, a
rope was hurled in after him, frenzied hands
whirled the motor, shot the blocks from under
the wheels.</p>

<p class='c008'>Up into the sky with meteoric swiftness rose
Raynor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Below him, men stared upward, faces tensed
with anguish as they watched his maneuvers.
What could he do? What help could he be
now?</p>

<p class='c008'>With every moment it seemed that the burning
plane must whirl downward and dash its
lone occupant to death. Tongues of flame
licked about it, reaching greedily for its vitals—the
controls. The wings of the plane had
been dipped in a fireproofing process, but now
even these were smouldering.</p>

<p class='c008'>Evidently the cockpit had become unbearable,
for the watchers on the ground descried
a figure creeping piteously out on a smoking
wing stretch.</p>

<p class='c008'>Charred bits began to float down. Raynor
was circling in, shortening his wide spirals,
dodging to the windward of flaming, floating
particles.</p>

<p class='c008'>Why didn’t he hurry? Why didn’t he swoop
in—now? Ah-h-h, the agony of it! The
doomed machine would be falling apart. It
shot flaring through the skies like a bird of
fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>Crouched on its furthest wing tip rode the
hapless young aviator, head bent away from
the searing heat that was creeping out and
out to him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c009'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br />AN AERIAL MESSAGE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Raynor seemed to have drawn as near as he
could to the burning plane; he hovered a little
above it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next instant a coil of rope shot down,
fell across the wing below. In a flash the victim
of the fire-trap had it in a noose under
his arms and swung himself clear of the already
crackling wing.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Raynor gently eased upward to take up
any slack in the rope, the flying death below
him burst into flame and began to collapse.
Some of the struts burned through and pieces
flew into the radius of the propeller, which
instantly smashed to pieces. Three seconds
later the machine began to fall. It staggered,
wheeled sideways and dived. Like a stone it
hurled groundward on the edge of the aviation
field.</p>

<p class='c008'>The crowd scattered in all directions, fleeing
from sparks, charred wing pieces, explosion
of fuel tank. A hangar roof caught fire
and the chemical guns had to be turned on to
put out the blaze.</p>

<p class='c008'>Raynor was coming down now, with his
dangling burden swinging beneath the plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>The crowd massed again, followed his progress
with anxious eyes. How was he going to
make it? Would his helpless, half-fainting
burden swing against building or tree tops,
would he be ground-dragged? There was the
lake. Would he risk a water landing?</p>

<p class='c008'>Fuz and Hal, eyes strained upward, shoulder
to shoulder in the crowd, seemed to feel
their hearts beat as one.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If only he could drop us word what he
wants us to do,” moaned Fuz. “Needs his
radio, or something in the sky—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He could telegraph us,” said Hal, “if—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If he had that old dot-and-dash system we
used to hammer to each other on water pipes—only
he’s got nothing to hammer—Jumping
Jerusalem!” shrieked Fuz. “He’s downing
come—I mean, come downing—oh-h-h!” and
excitement mixed Fuz’s words for him in the
old childish manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>And down Raynor came. With no system of
ground communication on his boat, he had to
come as best he could and trust to luck.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nearer down swung the roped burden.
Folks could see now why the boy had never
jumped from the death-trap of the burning
plane—his parachute pack hung in scorched
shreds. Sparks must have done for him there
first of all.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sensing a ground-drag, Raynor rose a bit,
then lowered, and with masterly hand held the
ship to steady placement in air, while men
reached upward to receive the boy. Someone
had had presence of mind to stand by with
opened knife—a slash at the rope and the boy
was free. They laid him out, insensible, but
with life still in him—a marvel, after the danger
he had incurred.</p>

<p class='c008'>Raynor landed farther out, taxied in. He
crawled from his ship with knees trembling
beneath him. The strain on him had been
terrific.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now that it was all over, Hal found his own
limbs quivering. This thing had unnerved
him—and others too. All about him he saw
men with lips still white from the strain, bodies
relaxed, huddling against some support.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had thought that in the face of such
near-tragedy, school schedule would be
broken, the remaining flights for the day be
put off. But no—already an instructor had
swung round in quick reproof on a boy who
had developed nerves and was begging off.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Planes out for the next flight up!” barked
the pilot. “Danger is the aviator’s schoolmaster—we
must learn from everything.”</p>

<p class='c008'>On his way to the hangar, Hal passed Fuz,
already climbing in a cockpit, and whispered,
“I’ve thought of something—am going to send
you a message in the sky—listen for it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For the flyers in the sky, the rest of the
afternoon was a busy time. With each student
in his plane went a data board and on it he was
to do map-work, but not the usual maps that
land folks know.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was the class in meteorology, or the
study of the air itself. Hal Dane was finding
that flying was a complex vocation. Acquiring
aircraft knowledge required study in such
varied directions—study of iron and steel and
linen and silk, the compass and oils and combustion,
and now today, the study of what effect
the sun has on the earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sun, Hal decided, was the cause of a
great deal of trouble. As he studied, he found
that the sun by shining brightly in the morning
heated up the earth and the air above it. Then
the warm air expanded and took up moisture.
In the afternoon, when the sun began to go
down, the air cooled and descended towards
earth. And that was where troubles generated.
In the cooling, particles of air moisture
condensed, then electricity accumulated—then
next, like as not, a thunderstorm burst.</p>

<p class='c008'>An aviator had to know these and a million
other things, so as to gauge oncoming air disturbances,
and dodge twisters and storm
winds by dropping to a calmer level, or rising
above storm.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the days of his old glider experiments,
Hal had found for himself that winds are generally
prevalent over waters, and that hills
make rising currents one can soar upon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now this deeper study of winds and fogs,
of up and down currents, of the startlingly
strange effects that water, forests and deserts
have upon air currents—all this fascinated
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he read the air-speed indication and the
altitude on his instruments, his busy hand
drew waves and spiral lines on his data board—his
map, showing currents and lay-out of
the air stratum he had been assigned to.</p>

<p class='c008'>He loved the work, could have kept at it
hours longer, but dusk was coming on, the
other planes were already dropping down.</p>

<p class='c008'>Old Fuz was still up. Hal suddenly remembered
the ridiculous whispered promise he had
made to Fuz. He began to circle the other
plane, sending his own engine into a sharp
staccato sputtering: “T-t-t-tat t-tat tat!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal swept closer. “T-tat t-tat!” roared his
engine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fuz must be working his brain overtime on
wavy line maps, must be asleep at the stick or
something. It was exasperating. And he had
told Fuz to be on the lookout.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal zoomed high, then circled low again,
sending his engine into such a sputter that it
began to miss and he had to shoot the juice
to it and fly straight for a stretch.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fuz was a dumb-head, he was a—</p>

<p class='c008'>Of a sudden Hal broke out into a laugh and
whirled his plane back into his circling above
the landing field.</p>

<p class='c008'>A staccato t-t-t-tat from the other plane had
answered him. Good old Fuz, he hadn’t forgotten
after all!</p>

<p class='c008'>For half an hour longer the two boys circled
high and low in the air, making their engines
“talk” in a sputter of aerial telegraphy based
on the old dot-and-dash code they had worked
out long ago in their tappings on land things,
on stones, on water pipe.</p>

<p class='c008'>With practice, they found they could speed
and cut the engine to series of staccato barks
that simulated fair enough the tap of a telegraph
instrument. They felt foolishly exuberant
and tapped each other all kinds of messages.</p>

<p class='c008'>They landed in the dusk with planes gassy
with engine fumes, but with happy-go-lucky
laughter in their own hearts.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was laughter that soon ceased, for each
walked straight into the grasp of an enraged
official, posted to wait for them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your flying days are over,” each was informed,
and was ordered to report to the office
after the evening meal.</p>

<p class='c008'>Neither Hal nor Fuz had any hankering for
supper that night. As soon as the seemingly
endless meal was over, they hurried, rather
white-lipped, to the office.</p>

<p class='c008'>There they found awaiting them, assembled
like a judge and jury, Mr. Rand, Colonel Elwin
himself, Raynor, Weston and a couple of
other instructors. Raynor and Weston had
the drawn, haggard look of men sitting in at
their own execution. There was a hard firmness
on the faces of the other men.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal Dane sought with agony in his heart
for the clue to this summons to appear before
a judgment seat—this summons and the verdict
already rendered, “Your flying days are
over,” that had dropped like a ton of rock on
all his hopes, crushed out his whole future.
And it was happening so close to what would
have been the first glorious upward step in
his career,—his graduation from an accredited
aviation school. With the Rand-Elwin
O. K. on him he could have secured a
flying job anywhere—the flying world would
have been open to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>What would his mother and Uncle Tel do—how
would he ever go back to them, broken
under some sort of disgrace—</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal’s misery of trapped thoughts whirling
madly in his brain was interrupted by the firm
harshness of Colonel Elwin’s voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have here,” his hands turning over several
cards and slips of paper, “reports from
various ground officials that you two students
stayed in the air an hour overtime this afternoon,
tampering with engines, and riding
with motors missing—when every principle
of air flight warns a flyer to seek a landing
when his motor misses. No matter how well
a man flies, we can never make an aviator out
of him if he hasn’t sense enough to know that
he is in deadly peril if he continues to fly a
missing engine. A knock in a motor presages
engine trouble, and engine trouble presages a
forced landing. At the first hint of mechanical
defection, it’s a flyer’s duty to head down
and make as speedy and safe a landing as
possible—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—” Hal Dane opened his mouth to speak,
then closed it. No words seemed to come.</p>

<p class='c008'>Colonel Elwin went on without pause, as
though he had heard no interruption.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is, of course, a disappointment to us to
have this serious flaw in your flying ability
revealed. Especially since one of you boys
had been brought to our notice as having
rather a genius for mechanics, a talent for
engines and an outlook for the future of
motors from an aerial viewpoint. That’s
what makes it so heinous, so foolish for one
who knows engines to be willing to tamper
with them dangerously in mid-air, to risk
valuable life and valuable machinery.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What, may I ask, was your idea in generating
peril for yourselves up in the air?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We—I mean—I was testing out a sort of
aerial telegraphy,” Hal finally got the words
out, “and—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aerial telegraphy—what?” both Mr. Rand
and Colonel Elwin seemed to ejaculate
simultaneously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was my fault, not McGinnis’s,” said Hal,
stiffening his back a little, and trying to keep
his voice firm. “I thought it up and got him
to try it out with me—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was in it as much as Hal Dane,” Fuz
seemed to have found his voice. “I’m plumb
due to get washed out if he is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aerial telegraphy—what was your idea—how
were you managing it?” Mr. Rand
leaned forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You see Fuz McGinnis and I have known
each other always. We used to have a secret
dot-and-dash code when we lived back home,
used to tap each other messages.” Hal seemed
to forget for the moment that he was up before
the “Benzine Board,” was being washed
out of flying forever perhaps. He warmed to
his subject. “It just occurred to me that
while we were up in the air, it might come in
pretty handy sometime to send the other
fellow a message. You might need to tell him
something, or ask for help quick! The motor
running is about all you can hear in the airplane.
So it just came to me to take a try
at making the motor do the talking, to cut it
and race it in a sort of code.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did it work?” questioned Mr. Rand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It sure did!” Fuz answered. “Dane asked
me if I was hungry, and I tapped back to him
I could eat a—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So it did work,” put in Mr. Rand. “Interesting—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quite interesting, and quite dangerous!”
Colonel Elwin’s dry, hard voice took up the
case again. “You boys risked clogging your
motors, and weakening down the exhaust
valves, incandescence from carbon!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But don’t you think—” Mr. Rand had the
floor again—“don’t you think that since it
was not mere useless daredeviltry but a real
experiment that these boys were trying out,
that we might—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well—er, yes, I might be made to see it
that way.” A ghost of a smile tugged at
Colonel Elwin’s iron mouth. “Shall we let
this case drop into what we call suspended
judgment?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah-h!” A vast sigh of relief burst from
both boys.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But remember,” Elwin’s jaw settled back
into its iron firmness, “the judgment still
hangs over you—it’s merely suspended. No
more tampering with engines in the air.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c009'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />QUICK ACTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Against fluffy white clouds below a bright
blue sky, an airplane spread its graceful
shape.</p>

<p class='c008'>Down on the Rand-Elwin field a host of
students and visitors watched that ship of the
air. Its pilot was Hal Dane. For a space he
cradled along, a mere speck gently floating up
there in the immensity of the ether. Then
like a mad thing his ship began to fall, rolling
and twisting and turning. At impossible
angles it came to life, righted itself to spring
upward—only to fall into worse dilemmas.
Now he was diving, only two hundred feet
above earth, and flying upside down. On the
verge of crash, and in an agonizing slow roll,
the ship slid back into normal flying position.
High again—then a dangerous glide over the
dragging tops of trees, and only the climbing
reversal of the Chandelle saving him from
wreck. Young Dane began to fall into the
most deadly spin of them all, the whirling
stall. He verged on that spin, yet never quite
permitted it to become a spin. Instead, he
slipped and stalled and trod the air until he
fought his plane back into safety.</p>

<p class='c008'>It might seem that young Dane was a daredevil
fool risking both his neck and his plane
in a useless show-off. But the group watching
from the Rand-Elwin field knew there was a
purpose and a real reason behind every one
of these stunts. Hal Dane had been sent up
to demonstrate that the Rand-Elwin School
prepared its flyers to face practically every
known emergency. Deliberately Hal Dane
had forced his ship into spins and stalls that
many a pilot would have come out of—in a
casket and with a lily in his hand. Instead,
with the stored-up skill bought of splendid
teaching and relentless practice, the boy rolled
or whipped or glided out of every danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dropping out of freak flying into a series
of long, swooping curves, Hal descended toward
the field and made a landing so gently
that he would hardly have jarred a glass of
water on a dinner table.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other flyers went up. There were planes
all over the sky, outdoing themselves in loops
and spins and whirls.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was a big day at the Rand-Elwin field.
Colonel Bob Wiljohn, a man of immense
wealth and interested in the future of aviation,
was a guest of the school. As part
owner in the Wiljohn Airplane factories, at
Axion, he was acting as representative of his
firm in a search for young pilots of sufficient
training and capability to handle their makes
of planes as demonstrators. It was a compliment
to an air school to have a man like
Colonel Wiljohn inspect its student ranks in
search of men for his aviation program.</p>

<p class='c008'>After lunch and an inspection of equipment,
rooms and hangars, the Colonel and his constant
companion, his grandson Jacky Wiljohn,
were out on the field again.</p>

<p class='c008'>Colonel Wiljohn was a tall, muscular man,
with a look of youth in his keen gray eyes
despite the lines on his tanned face and his
white hair. The type of man that kept young
by his intense interest in big things and the
future trend of affairs. Jacky, his grandson,
was getting aviation in the blood at an early
age. The little fellow with his close-clipped
hair and wide-open black eyes, must have been
only five or thereabouts, yet he could speak
familiarly of water-cooled engine, and struts,
and spar, and other lingo of aircraft.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Colonel was not only a builder of planes,
but also a flyer of some note. It was natural
that he should want to view the Rand-Elwin
field from the air as well as from the ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal could see one of the big, new trimotors
being trundled out for his use. A pilot in
helmet and flying clothes warmed her up and
slid under the controls. Hal’s eyes widened.
It was Fuz—Fuz McGinnis that was to take
her up. Some honor for the old boy! He’d
liked to have been in Fuz’s boots himself. But
Fuz deserved it; he was a crack airman, that
boy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Colonel Wiljohn and Jacky, the youngster
grinning happily over his miniature aviation
togs, were already aboard.</p>

<p class='c008'>Down the runway came the plane, maneuvered
some slight obstruction, then gathered
speed and soared into the air like a great
bird of the skies.</p>

<p class='c008'>McGinnis must be on his mettle; he had
achieved the rise full two hundred yards
within the end of the runway. A brisk shout
of admiration followed his take-off—then the
shout died into a composite gasp of dismay.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The wheel—look!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Just at the rise of the plane, the wheel on
the left side had crumpled and now swung a
useless, dangerous mass beneath the ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mercy on him,” moaned Hal, “half his
landing gear ruined! He’s in for a smash!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ninety-nine chances out of a hundred are
against him,” half-whispered Rex Raynor
who was standing near, eyes glued on the
beautiful plane circling so gracefully in the
sky above.</p>

<p class='c008'>Both he and Hal knew well enough what
was likely to happen when the aviator came
down to a landing with only one wheel to
make the ground contact. A crash, an overturn,
a complete capsizing that would spell
the end for the occupants. And that boy
Jacky in there too, a young life to be so
horribly snuffed out.</p>

<p class='c008'>None of the occupants of the ship were
aware of what had happened. They circled
serenely, while all unknown to them a death
trap swung beneath their speeding plane.
That slight obstruction on the runway must
have cracked the gear, but the actual buckling
of the wheel must not have occurred till the
very moment of the take-off, and so had
passed unnoticed.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the throng of sightseers crowding the
field, the dangle of broken gear had slight
significance as to the terrible danger it
presaged. But every student, pilot and mechanic
knew what must eventually happen—unless
the aviator in the damaged ship could
be warned!</p>

<p class='c008'>On the ground, men rushed about, shouting,
pointing to gear of other machines, hoping to
attract the attention of those in the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>But for the flyers in the roaring ship, the
shouts from far-away human pin-points on
the earth below must have been as mere
whispers, as nothing at all. There was no
sign that any of this ground commotion ever
reached the ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other pilots began to rush out machines and
warm them up, preparatory to rising in the
air to carry their warning shouts and pantomime
within closer range of the damaged sky
ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>Raynor was one of the first of these. Even
as he raced his engine for the take-off, Hal
Dane shouted after him, “Wait—I’ll be with
you—give me one second!”</p>

<p class='c008'>With strength that he had hardly known
was in him, the boy wrenched off the whole
metal-spoked wheel of a bicycle that leaned
against a hangar wall. The next instant
he had leaped to the cockpit, carrying the
wrenched, wracked piece of machinery with
him. With that broken wheel he hoped to
pantomime, to talk in dumb show, and reach
the doomed flyers where shouting failed.</p>

<p class='c008'>To overtake them was the problem of the
next moment.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great trimotor had risen high in the air,
and instead of circling over the various sections
of the Rand-Elwin field had zoomed off
into a sudden flight at a speed that would soon
make it a diminishing speck on the horizon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other planes darted after it, striving desperately
to hang on to its tail, to keep some
glimpse of it in eye. Once lost from view, the
plane would be doomed—none to warn it—a
crash in some landing field!</p>

<p class='c008'>But the trimotor had speed, and the start.
The diminishing speck became an atom, became
nothing—the vast universe of the sky
swallowed it up.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pursuit ships began to turn back. It looked
too hopeless. None knew where the big ship
was headed. With no track or clew to follow,
even a slight deviation now at the beginning
of the flight would lead them into a diverging
angle miles and miles away from the true
course of the damaged plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>Raynor was among the few that held
doggedly on. Because his boat was a fast one,
he was leaving the others. He plunged
straight ahead in a course he seemed to have
set for himself from the beginning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once he called through the tube, “Clanton—commercial
field—Wiljohn left packet of
papers there—must be going back for them—”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a desperate chance. Wiljohn might
be going to any of a hundred places. Even if
they sighted a ship and tailed it into Clanton,
it might prove to be any of the thousands of
sky craft that filled the air these days.</p>

<p class='c008'>Still it was the only clew they had. They
could follow it blindly—that was all.</p>

<p class='c008'>Twenty-three miles from the Rand-Elwin
Field to Clanton! With its newer speed and
power, the big ship could make it in say nine-tenths
of their own flying time. A mere fraction
of time, a few moments out of all eternity!
Yet those few moments could spell death to
three unwarned passengers.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the fringes of Clanton, Raynor overhauled
a few leisurely flying ships from the
commercial field. On ahead, and drifting
back through their hum, was another and
more powerful sound of motors. That could
be the trimotor. If it were not, then their
whole desperate race had been in vain.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were now pressing up towards that
larger ship, whatever it was, that was leading
them into Clanton. Its motors seemed to reduce
ever so slightly—cutting in for the landing
field, it must be.</p>

<p class='c008'>Raynor was making it in with every ounce
of speed, pushing forward, overhauling the
big boat by faint degrees. He must make it
now, catch her before the ground swoop, circle
her to give the warning signals.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal, with a hurried call to the pilot, slipped
the hearing tube from under his helmet, and
began a swift clambering out on the plane
wing. The thrill of the old circus stunt days
was upon him. He felt the old surges of
power and balance shoot through him as he
wing-walked, went to the very tip, carrying
with him his signal of the broken bicycle
wheel.</p>

<p class='c008'>He must catch Fuz’s attention. Colonel Wiljohn’s,
little Jacky’s even—make one of the
three see him, sense the danger message he
would pantomime. If necessary, he would
climb aloft to upper wing space, circus-stunt
there silhouetted against the sky,—anything
to catch the eye!</p>

<p class='c008'>Fuz his friend, this gray-haired grandfather,
this child—any risk to save them!</p>

<p class='c008'>But as Hal prepared to climb struts to the
plane top, he saw it was too late. Time had
passed for catching any eye by acrobatics
now.</p>

<p class='c008'>Like a meteor, the boy shot down the length
of the plane wing, dropped back into the pit.
In a frenzy, he shouted through the tube,
“Risk it with me—one chance—give me the
control!”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a risk, in more ways than one. With
an instructor from his flying school beside
him, Hal Dane began to disobey orders, began
a stunt that must mean the end of his flying
certificate.</p>

<p class='c008'>Already the trimotor was circling for the
glide to landing—and to death!</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no time left to ride abreast, to
wave, to make any signal for the eye. But
there was the ear, the hearing, still a last
chance left to try. Even though Raynor’s
ship rode behind, it could send sound traveling
forward through the air. Would Fuz
McGinnis catch that sound?</p>

<p class='c008'>In an agony, Hal Dane cut the motor,
speeded it. Cut, speed! Cut, speed! “T-t-t-tat
t-tat t-tat!” The old code, the call!</p>

<p class='c008'>Through the air, Hal sent wave after wave
of sputtering sound, a staccato call, “S. O. S.—danger—keep
flying!”</p>

<p class='c008'>But McGinnis in the plane ahead seemed
deaf to any sound save the roar of his own
motor.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was swooping low—and lower!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br />VISION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Hal Dane was above the trimotor now, and
was still sending out his desperate aerial telegraph
call, “T-t-t-tat tat-t-tat t-tat—danger—keep
flying—danger!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He had raced and choked and pounded his
engine till smoke fumes discharged gassily
from it. The next sputter might stall a filthy
motor to a “conk” in mid-air, might back-fire
flame into the carburetor. Yet the message
must still go on. Three lives depended on that
one hairbreadth chance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Danger—keep flying!”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the trimotor was going down. It
swooped to five hundred—three hundred—began
to flatten at two hundred feet for the last
lap of the down glide.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Danger! Danger! Danger!” shrieked the
tortured staccato of the higher plane. “Danger!
Danger! Keep flying!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Even as the great plane below swooped to
strike earth, its pilot lifted wings in a mighty
upward dart. Higher and higher he rose.
Behind him trailed his own call in aerial telegraphy.
“Danger—where—what?” roared the
staccato bellow of the trimotor.</p>

<p class='c008'>In their brief code, Hal Dane tapped back
the answer on his engine, and urged return
flight to the school aviation field before attempting
the landing.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Raynor and Hal circled near, they could
see McGinnis turn the control over to Colonel
Wiljohn. Then the boy climbed out over the
side of the plane and swung head downward
to see if he could reach the broken gear and
perhaps lash it back into place.</p>

<p class='c008'>A hopeless task, it appeared, for Fuz
McGinnis slowly dragged himself back into
the cockpit. Soon the plane circled and headed
back for the Rand-Elwin grounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>All that wild race to Clanton had taken a
bare fifteen minutes. Another quarter of an
hour saw them back above the home field.</p>

<p class='c008'>Raynor and Hal made their descent in record
time, leaped from the plane and raced for
the edge of the field. Men jostled together to
give these two room. Like the rest of the
waiting throng they stood, heads back, eyes
glued to the crippled sky craft.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’s coming—now!” It was a whisper, a
prayer that came from every heart and lip in
the crowd.</p>

<p class='c008'>The plane was coming down in wide, slow
circles.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Atta boy, you’re bringing her in beautifully—yet
every odd’s against you!” gritted
Raynor through set teeth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But he’s got a chance, one chance,” muttered
Hal, gripping Rex Raynor’s arm and
pointing excitedly. “If he keeps to the balance
he’s got—runs on that one wheel to lose momentum,
it can—”</p>

<p class='c008'>It could.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fuz McGinnis held his plane to angle of
balance, even as he sped half a hundred feet
on the one wheel after he struck ground.
Then came a tearing, splintering crash as the
plane shot sideways, dragging the down wing
into mangled wreckage. Even so, the greatest
danger mark had been passed. That one-wheel
run had spent the worst of the dread
momentum.</p>

<p class='c008'>Guards held the frantic crowd back while
experienced hands tore at the wreckage, lifted
out the occupants. The three of them were
dazed, bruised, cut about hands and face from
flying pieces of wood and fabric. But the
miracle of it—they were alive, practically unhurt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fuz McGinnis stood for a long minute leaning
weakly against the tilted mass of wing
debris. His face held the look of one who has
been on a far journey and is not quite sure he
is really on home land once again. As he came
out of his daze, he leaned over and gripped
Hal Dane in a shaky grasp.</p>

<p class='c008'>“B-boy,” he said, “if you hadn’t that message
us to got—no, no, got that message to us,
I mean, we’d have been—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’d have been dead,” broke in Colonel
Wiljohn. “But you brought the word, in a
blasted clever way. You turned some sort of
tomfoolery into lifesaving. We owe our lives
to you both. I—I—we thank you.” Reaching
down, Colonel Wiljohn swept his grandson
into his arms, pressed the child against his
face. Then he set the little fellow down and
gravely instructed him to give a handshake of
thanks to each of the young fellows.</p>

<p class='c008'>The crowd would be denied no longer. It
broke through the guards, surged over to
the little group beside the wreck. Women
laughed and sobbed in relief as they saw the
child standing unhurt, clinging to his grandfather’s
hand. Men laughed huskily and tried
to hide emotion in heavy handclasps. They
wanted the whole story,—how had McGinnis
brought her down without a worse wreck,
where had Raynor and young Dane found
them, got the warning across to them?</p>

<p class='c008'>It was full thirty minutes before the crowd
could be dispersed so wreckers could haul off
the disabled plane, and so the aviators in this
thrilling episode could slip away to some place
of quiet and rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>That night Hal Dane and Fuz McGinnis attended
their first banquet. It was not altogether
an unmixed pleasure—this the first
formal festival in the whole of their work-filled
young lives. The fact that they were
seated rather high was not altogether comforting
to their timidity, either. This was the
celebration that had been planned weeks
ahead of time and was staged to do honor to
the school’s guest, Colonel Wiljohn. Then
here at the eleventh hour, so to speak, and at
the Colonel’s especial request, this couple of
young aviators had been dragged in to sit next
to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was comforting to feel the Colonel’s
kindly presence but even that did not compensate
entirely for the unmitigated terror of a
startling array of forks with varying uses
staring balefully up at one from the heavy
linen of a banquet cloth. One felt conspicuous
in such a dazzle of lights, in such a gathering
of notables.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not much up on banquets,” hoarsely
whispered Hal under cover of a speech by one
of the notables. “Y-you don’t reckon anybody’ll
expect us to say anything?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gosh, no!” from Fuz. “Anybody could
look at us and know we couldn’t talk. But
something else is bothering me—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bothering me, too,” mumbled Hal, and
subsided glumly beside a plate of broiled
chicken, green peas and mushrooms in ramekins,
potatoes in some newfangled way, a
spiced jelly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Colonel Bob Wiljohn responded to a speech
of welcome. Other speeches followed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Hal Dane and Fuz McGinnis became
redly aware that Mr. Rand, standing very
erect beside the table, was talking in a serious
voice and mentioning their names considerably.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The blow’s going to fall now,” Hal’s lips
silently sent a message to his chum.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We have here an extraordinary case.” Mr.
Rand’s voice was stern. “It concerns two of
our most brilliant pupils in aviation—and on
the eve of their graduation. Although under
a sentence of suspended judgment already,
they have now risked locking the doors of
graduation on themselves forever by flagrant
disobedience of strict orders—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I protest—” Colonel Wiljohn was on his
feet, gray eyes flashing. “Your words give
the wrong impression. You mean two boys
entered a risk to save a valuable plane if possible,
to save human lives—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait, wait! And I accept your protest,
Colonel.” Mr. Rand’s eyes also held a flash, a
high enthusiasm, his stern mouth relaxed into
a smile. “I want to state further that we, the
board of officers of this institution, had already
decided—against all past precedent and
rules—to ignore said flagrant act of disobedience,
and to graduate these two young men—with
honors!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Waves of hand-clapping and cheers broke
over a couple of dazed young aviators.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So the—” Fuz muttered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The ‘Benzine Board’ didn’t get us after
all,” finished Hal.</p>

<p class='c008'>That very night Colonel Wiljohn had a long
talk with the boys and offered them work. He
could use them well. They had both displayed
an uncanny aptitude for flying, and he needed
plane demonstrators. Hal’s instructors, Raynor
and Major Weston, had told him enough
about the boy’s unusual grasp of engine mechanics
to arouse his interest. This keen,
successful business man got up and walked
the floor in his excitement as he and Hal
delved further into the boy’s future-looking
ideas for invention in harnessing piston
power for landing planes gently and with a
lessening of landing dangers. His factories,
he said, were willing to pay well for brains,
needed young fellows with vision, both in the
flying and in the invention departments.
Would they consider coming with him?</p>

<p class='c008'>Would they?</p>

<p class='c008'>Young McGinnis quite emphatically mixed
his words hind-part-before in the fervor of
assuring Colonel Wiljohn of his willingness to
go.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the space of a minute Hal Dane sat
perfectly still, eyes wide open, but in them the
look of a man in a dream. He was in a dream;
this was the beginning of visions about to
come true. It couldn’t be real. He’d wake
up—</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m counting on you.” Colonel Wiljohn’s
strong, friendly hand grasped his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—yes, sir—I’ll be on hand,” Hal finally got
out.</p>

<p class='c008'>Leaving the Rand-Elwin Flying School
seemed to Hal like turning over one of the
busiest, happiest pages of his life. He parted
from his splendid, true friends here with real
regret. Yet, like all youth, he was eager to
turn the next page of life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before he entered upon his new work, there
was time for a brief visit with his home folks.
He found the old house still uprearing its
makeshift patchwork roof among the tree
tops. Within, though, the money that he’d
managed to save and send home in carnival
days had wrought some comfortable changes.
There were rugs, dainty curtains, a piece or
two of new furniture. He found his mother
and Uncle Tel not so ground down with toil
these days. In his mind, Hal was already
looking forward. to other changes—a roof,
and a coat of creamy white paint for the
house, a little car so the folks could get around—just
wait till he began making some real
money!</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>For Hal Dane, life at the Wiljohn Works
promised to be the greatest thrill he had ever
known. Up till now he had not realized the
vast extent, both in space and operations, of
a modern aviation factory. It was not one
factory, but many. There was a bewildering
variety to the output.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal had thought the Works concentrated
on some special type of plane. Instead, he
found them manufacturing about everything
from a small, neat sky boat for private use up
to giant craft for freight and passenger airliners.
There were air boats with wings that
folded up so one could trundle them into the
family garage instead of into a hangar.</p>

<p class='c008'>Over in the invention department tests of
all kinds were being continually conducted.
With his keen gray eyes looking well to the
future, Colonel Wiljohn was willing to try out
in his laboratories things which to more conservative
men seemed mere schemes and
addle-pated ideas. If a scheme failed in the
testing, it was just another visionary mechanism
to be set aside. If one idea out of ten,
out of a hundred even, proved to have worth,
aviation had made a forward step!</p>

<p class='c008'>In the parachute department strange
weaves of silk were being tested for qualities
and purposes that silk makers of fifty years
ago never dreamed would ever be demanded
of their products. According to laboratory
decision, the habutai silk in present use for
parachutes would soon be displaced by a new
weave, the basket-mesh type. And why?
Because the basket-weave oscillated less than
the old habutai type, it absorbed shock better,
it lowered more slowly and allowed for better
landings. Silk that once fulfilled its purpose
if it had a sheen and gloss to catch milady’s
eye! And now it was demanded that it have
a strength to lower man ten thousand feet
through the air without a jostle and land him
on earth without a bruise!</p>

<p class='c008'>In the engine room, motors were being tried
out for streamlines and cooling systems, for
weight reduction and elimination of fire
hazards, for burning new high-powered fuel
oils.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where the prevailing wing material had
formerly been wood and fabric, tests were
now being made to prove the worth of all-metal
construction. For new purposes the old-time
metallic standbys were found unusable.
Light metals crystallized and snapped into
brittle pieces. The old strong metals possessed
of endurance were too heavy for aircraft.
A new metal, light as aluminum and
strong as steel, must be produced.</p>

<p class='c008'>And so the experimenting and testing went
on.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Hal Dane became familiar with some of
the scientific revolution and evolution going
on at the huge Wiljohn Works, he caught
again something of the high splendid vision of
following the river of the wind on a great
exploration. If ever he were to go as sky
viking, here in this vast plant were being
riveted and welded aircraft suitable to bear
him on that journey.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br />DOWN THROUGH THE AIR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>With wire braces screaming, a plane shot
downward a thousand feet and the pilot
struggled to bring his ship out of the left spin.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pilot was Hal Dane. He had been with
the Wiljohn Works nearly a year now. In
that time he had participated in some marvelous
experiments, tried out in the hope of
furthering the safety of aviation.</p>

<p class='c008'>A room painted black, strung with wires,
some bats turned loose in it, and doors and
windows closed to darken it totally—this
might seem childish dabbling when thought of
in connection with the modern science of
aviation. Yet it was a test tried out with a
very real purpose. Outside of that room men
waited at ear-phones connected electrically
with those wires so that the least flutter of a
bat’s wing against a wire would be indicated.
The bats flew madly round and round the
room, but never so much as touched one of
the many wires. From this experiment scientists
contended that bats flying in the air
put out some sound and get an echo from that
sound when it vibrates near an object. Not
so far and foolish a leap from bats to aviation
after all! For if a human flyer of the air
could devise a ship that put out a sound and
got an echo when it approached an object, it
would help solve the problem of landing in
the dark and of flying in fogs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fog, the heavy, silent, dreaded enemy of
every aviator! At the Wiljohn Works continuous
experimentation went on to help solve
the dangers of fog flying. An electrical instrument
to measure distance from the
ground in tens of feet would help an aviator
trying to land in the dark. A mechanical eye
to see through the fog was a crying need.
Work was being pushed along both of these
lines.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another and very different type of experimentation
was the testing of the wings and
shapes of aircraft in connection with their
air resistance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tests for great altitude, however,
thrilled Hal Dane more than anything else.
Through all this present labor and study, the
call of the river of the winds still lured him.
And to ride the currents of the air rivers at
their swiftest, one must be able to withstand
the velocities and the pressure of the air
heights. The fearful cold of high altitudes
unbalanced ships with heavy coatings of ice,
clogged instruments and air indicator tubes
with snow. Wiljohn men were pushing experiments
for such flying. Already a spread
of emulsions on the wings had been found to
reduce the ice danger. But for real success,
aviators must learn to wholly master the air
heights.</p>

<p class='c008'>Still another type of work was the testing
of completed planes. No Wiljohn ship was
permitted to leave the factory until it had
been thoroughly tried out.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal Dane was up in one of these new planes
now—and was coming down in a wrong spin.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a new type training ship that the
navy had ordered. In the work it was built
for, the plane might never be put to any particular
stress and strain. Yet no flyer can
predict what risk may suddenly be thrust
upon any ship up in the air. So, like all planes
constructed at the Wiljohn Works, it had to
be subjected to the worst conditions that
might ever overtake any aviator.</p>

<p class='c008'>All in the course of his usual everyday
work, Hal Dane had been ordered to take her
up and put her through her paces. First he
was to shoot for altitude, next dive vertically,
full engine, for eight thousand feet, then
straighten out to volplane safely to ground in
circling glides.</p>

<p class='c008'>At twelve thousand feet he had gone into
the dive, but instead of falling straight, some
faulty mechanism of the ship had hurled it
into the dread left spin. Many an aviator
would have crawled out then and sought
safety in a parachute jump. Young Dane had
gone up to test this ship, and test it he would,
fighting it down to a last margin for a safety
leap.</p>

<p class='c008'>Three times he exerted every ounce of
strength that was in him towards a right pull
so that the torque or twisting force of the
motor would bring him out of the spin. But
the machine would not respond. Another
thousand feet—a wrench! And, ah, he had
done it, she was coming straight! Mentally,
Hal began cataloging the spiraling, the drop,
the wrench he had just been through, trying
to visualize the engine faults that had brought
these on. Too much weight here, not enough
strength there. Bad faults, but there were
remedies.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was diving pretty now, straight on, like
something shot out of a cannon mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then at seven thousand feet down things
began to happen. Before Hal Dane could
realize it, the ship literally shattered to pieces
under him. A crash, a rending, a tearing!</p>

<p class='c008'>He jack-knifed forward across the safety
belt and force hurled him head-on against the
board, knocking him unconscious. A fuselage
gone crazy, wings torn off, tail torn off, shot
in sickening whirls towards the ground.
Strapped to it, rode Hal Dane, stunned into
the unconsciousness of “little death,” while
real death rose up with the ground to meet
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he fell, rushing air partly cleared his
brain. But a flying-man’s instinct, not conscious
thought, set his hands to fumbling the
safety belt, to feeling for the ring of his parachute
cord. Instinct freed him, sent him
climbing to the edge to step off into space.</p>

<p class='c008'>Things happen swiftly in the air. The ship
had already fallen a thousand feet while her
pilot rode her down in his dazed condition.
But even now it was still some three thousand
feet up—more than half a mile above earth.
As Hal leaped out, he looked back over his
shoulder to see in what direction the stripped
fuselage was heading.</p>

<p class='c008'>A moment more and he was hurtling down
through space! Now the wreckage of the
ship was even with him, now it had passed
him, its greater weight carrying it fast and
faster.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal’s fumbling fingers tugged at his rip
cord. He was falling head on—ages swept
past—would she never open? Then the parachute
blossomed into a great blessed silken
flower above him. The silk went taut, yanked
him back into an upright position. Beneath
the inverted chalice he floated. The earth had
ceased to rush up to meet him. It stayed
where it belonged—no, it was floating gently
up to meet him now. He was going out of his
head again, losing his grip on himself. Quick,
before blackness went over him again, he
must choose a place to land!</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked down, heard a crash as the ship
hit the ground. An airpath seemed sucking
him down, hurtling him on to land in the very
midst of the wreckage. Bad landing—flames
might burst out in that twisted mass below
him!</p>

<p class='c008'>Before his brain went blank again, he must
side slip, veer his parachute in a different direction.
With instinctive, mechanical motion,
his fingers reached up, caught a cluster of
shrouds in his hand and drew them down little
by little, spilling air from the ’chute. His
speed increased as the drop veered off at a
sharp gliding angle.</p>

<p class='c008'>All over. That must be ground below.</p>

<p class='c008'>But instead of solid contact, there came a
splash.</p>

<p class='c008'>One moment Hal Dane’s feet struck water,
the next moment he went down, engulfed!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c009'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br />TWO ROADS TO FAME</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Next thing Hal knew, he felt land grating
against him. A strong hand had him by the
collar dragging him out of the water, many
voices beat into his ears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh-h-h, by Jehoshaphat Jumping!” yelled
Fuz McGinnis as he threw his arms about
Hal’s dripping form. “We’d given up hope,
never believed we’d find you all in one piece!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a miracle.” Colonel Wiljohn slid an
arm around Hal’s waist to help him over to
the waiting automobile. “That dashed faulty
plane came down in shreds, spars gone here,
wings drifted yonder. I couldn’t tell in
heaven’s name where you were going to smash.
I shot cars and stretchers out in every direction.
And now I find you floating on our lake,
calm as somebody on a bed of roses—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“T-too bad I disappointed everybody by
coming down all in one p-p-piece!” chattered
the dripping Hal.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush, boy! No joking! Never have I suffered
such agony. I’m a thousand years
older.” Colonel Wiljohn yanked off his coat
and wrapped it around Hal. “Never, my
young friend, never shall I let you or any of
my aviators test out such a machine as this
again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Hal Dane did take up this same type of
ship again. He did it at his own risk, and at
his urgent insistence. From his perilous performance
in mid-air he thought that he knew
what were the faults of construction that had
caused the ship to shatter under strain. Previous
work in his department, the risk department,
had taught him to learn something of
real value to flying from every accident. In
this case, he asked for the chance to prove
what he had learned. So weeks later, he took
up the very same type of ship, greatly
strengthened, and put her through the same
test. This time he and the ship went up and
came down together, none the worse for wear,
and he could write O. K. on her examination
sheet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Testing other people’s inventions did not fill
all of Hal’s time. At nights, or whenever he
could snatch a few hours to himself, he was
forever pottering with pieces of fabric and
metal and wood. Table top, dresser top, every
available surface in his sleeping quarters
seemed cluttered with aviation trash. Only
not all of it was trash. Mixed in with wood
shavings and screws and wire coils was a
strange metal helmet, something like a diver’s
helmet, yet different,—light, graceful, not
cumbersome in shape. A tube could be attached
to the mouth-piece. Elsewhere in the
litter sat a miniature oxygen tank. In these
was expressed a forward thought for achievement
in high flying. Little models of engines
rubbed noses with wing models in various
stages of incompleteness. Above a chifferobe
was poised something that Hal Dane’s eyes
sought every time he entered his room—a completed
model of a plane. It was a slim silver
creation, all metal, and streamlined from engine,
through monoplane wing, back to tail.
Slender, yet with strength in every line!
Smoke blown against this model did not eddy
and swirl but slipped straight across her nonresistant
lines. With her length of wing, she
was built to ride the winds.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a wonder, Hal Dane was not studying
the beloved lines of his tiny, silvered wind
bird tonight. Instead, his fingers were
fiddling with a little flying toy manipulated
by a couple of twisted rubber bands to furnish
motive power. If he twisted the rubber tight
enough, the little windmill fans of the toy shot
it up to the ceiling. In the midst of one of
these flights, there came a sharp knock on the
door, and while Hal leaped to open it, the little
wind toy drifted down from the ceiling about
as straight as it had gone up.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the open doorway stood Colonel Wiljohn,
his fingers gripping a folded paper, his eyes
shining with an eager light as he watched the
wind toy whirl down.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ve got it—made a start on it anyway!”
the Colonel slapped the paper across
his palm excitedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sir—I’ve got it—what?” Hal stammered
in amazement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This thing,” Colonel Wiljohn stooped to
rescue the little wind toy from where it had
fluttered to the floor. “It seems like Fate that
you should be experimenting with such an
idea just when I come to bring you a certain
piece of news.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Colonel cleared a space on the cluttered
table, and spread open the paper he had
brought. Its black headlines announced:</p>

<p class='c008'>“The great Onheim prize offer—twenty-five
thousand dollars for the best safety device for
airships.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“See,” Colonel Wiljohn’s finger emphasized
the points, “twenty-five thousand dollars—safety
device. And already, without knowledge
of the money behind it, you were working
on a safety device—helicopter principle,
is it not?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not exactly helicopter—more of a gyroscope,”
Hal caught something of the Colonel’s
fire. “It’s been on my mind a long time that
one of the greatest dangers of aviation is the
huge space ’most any ship needs to come to
earth on. I’ve looked death mighty straight
in the eye some several times when forced
landings smacked me down in a tree top or on
a gully edge—when if I could have come down
zup! straight like the drop of a plummet, I
could have landed with a safety margin in
some small clear spot—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A small space to rise from is sometimes
as great a danger for a plane as a forced
landing, too,” interrupted the Colonel. “Say
you’re forced down on a mountain ledge, or a
tiny island—the average plane is done for
then. Has to be deserted to its fate for the
lack of a long, smooth runway needed for the
forward glide before the rise. Were you figuring
on the straight-up rise, as well as the
straight-down drop, with this heli—, I mean
gyroscope business?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In a way,” Hal answered as he began to fit
together certain scattered bits of miniature
machinery, picking up the pieces out of the
mixture on the table. Under his hands grew
a little short-wing airplane with a motor and
a propeller on the nose. Above it were set
fans like a windmill, only they lay horizontally
a-top the wings.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s the position of balance that I’ve been
working for,” went on Hal, setting the little
plane on his open palm and spinning the miniature
gyroscope with a motion of his other
hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>So far as a stationary plane was concerned,
the principle of the gyroscope seemed to work
out well. For no matter how Hal tilted his
palm to throw the plane off its balance, the
whirl of the wings above it was able to apply
power to the controls to steady it back into
upright position.</p>

<p class='c008'>Colonel Wiljohn took the model into his own
hands, studied it eagerly, turning it about to
examine minutely its tiny mechanism. “This
row of slot-like holes—in the air tube here,”
the Colonel held the thing closer to the light,
“what’s the idea in that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll laugh when you know what put that
idea in my head.” Hal grinned a little sheepishly
as he thought about it. “I got it from
watching something that never was in any
way intended to fly, something that no one
ever thought of in connection with flying at
all—a player piano!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A player piano—huh!” The Colonel
turned about so sharply that he nearly spilled
the plane model out of his grasp. “How in
the deuce did you ever extract an idea on aviation
out of one of those contraptions?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The thing just came to me all of a sudden
one day when I was watching one of those
mechanical pianos pounding out that ghostly
sort of music where the piano keys press up
and down, and the music blares out, but no
human hand touches the keys. Through the
glass front, I was watching the paper roll in
the piano, how it passed in front of a place
where air was applied. The air was blown
through the little holes in the paper, thus
striking the keys and playing the piano.
Right then the idea got me that when the airplane
gets off the horizontal or longitudinal
axis, a stream of air blowing through small
holes in a gyroscopic instrument could strike
the controls with the strength of a powerful
hand, thus bringing the plane back to its normal
position—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Right O, that’s just what it does, too!” The
Colonel thoughtfully spun the wind wheels of
the toy and watched how the thing righted
itself, no matter how he tilted it. “You’ve got
the biggest thing of the age here, boy, if it
just works out right in real flying mechanisms!
Bring your plans out to the laboratories
this week and let’s work the thing out
in a real powered model.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For weeks to come, Hal Dane was up to the
ears in work on his gyroscope. And Colonel
Wiljohn hung over him like a hen with one
chick, as eager as any boy over the outcome
of this revolutionary scheme of applying
player-piano principles to airships.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last a model was done, an all-metal miniature,
perfect as any real service-flight plane,
even to the engine on its nose. But in many
phases it ignored the known rules for making
the regulation type plane. It had small, fixed
wing surfaces, without even an attempt at
ailerons. The rear spread into an unknown
fantasy of a biplaned tail. On a metal framework
above the body of the plane were affixed
four limber metal rotor blades that hung with
a flimsy droop when the plane was still.</p>

<p class='c008'>Colonel Wiljohn’s countenance drooped
somewhat when he saw the finished product.
This model, so much larger than the tiny creation
he had balanced on his palm that night
in Hal’s room, had an awkward, fearfully
flimsy look. Was this the thing he had pinned
such faith to a few weeks ago?</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the motor of the big toy was warmed
up. Flimsy blades, that a moment ago had
hung limp, now stiffened with the whirl of
rotor force to a firmness that would withstand
a hundred horse power. Centrifugal force
did it! When the whir of its blades gathered
power, the thing rose—not with a glide, or a
slanting run to take the air, not at all—it rose
straight up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Beautiful, beautiful!” shouted Colonel
Wiljohn, his face tensing with excitement. “I
did not believe she could do it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Now the little plane was coming down. A
mechanism cut the motor dead. The thing
stopped in its “tracks,” so to speak, began to
drift down in a perfect vertical, the gentle
whir of the rotor blades holding the body balanced
to every air-bump or current of wind
that tended to shift the axis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ve got it all there, boy—goes straight
up, comes straight down, it’s a wonder—”
Colonel Wiljohn’s excited voice croaked to a
dismayed gasp.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was coming down—but in pieces. So
great was the power of the gyroscopic whirl
that the wings of the plane beneath them
broke asunder under the force of the air
streams hurled down. The whole little model
crashed downward in a wrecked mass.</p>

<p class='c008'>Week after week, Hal Dane pursued his
patient experimenting. He tried two rotors,
one above the other and traveling in opposite
directions, with the idea of equalizing balance
to the nth degree. It did not work; it only
complicated matters more. He made shorter,
the already short, fixed under-wings, and
tipped up their ends. Still the strain was unrelieved,
still the mechanism tore to pieces
under that whirling force. At last Hal got at
the root of the matter—it was too much power
hurled down by the gyroscope. By degrees,
he learned to decrease the size of the air slots
in the gyroscopic instruments, learned to shoot
the air stream in a more gradual manner until
he achieved just the amount to power the
controls, and yet not break them.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Colonel Wiljohn watched Hal’s final
model make its beautiful straight ascent, and
settle down with an equally beautiful vertical
descent, this veteran of aviation manufacturing
stood long, gazing out with dreamy eyes.
Finally he turned. “Hal Dane,” he said, “I’ve
been seeing a dream picture in the sky; it’s
the dream city all our artists have been painting
ever since the Wrights flew their first
plane off Kill Devil Hill. In this pictured city-to-be,
airplane terminals are built right upon
the roofs of high down-town buildings; every
little home has its private landing field upon
its own rooftop; big planes, little planes swoop
straight up without ever a wasted acre of runway.
Until this minute, we have never been
an inch nearer that marvelous goal than we
were twenty-seven years ago. Suddenly you
open up a new world in aviation. Come over
to the office and let’s talk business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Behind his familiar desk with its papers
strewn comfortably to hand, Colonel Wiljohn
took up the conversation again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This gyroscope idea is all your own, you
have worked it out well in model. To put it
into a practical, working-sized plane will take
money. In fact you will need a great deal of
money—which you haven’t got. To a degree,
I am a man of wealth. But at present, my factories
need a stirring advertising campaign,
something to turn the eyes of the world
towards us. The Bojer Works, and others
that turn out planes inferior to ours, are by
their daring advertisements deflecting part
of our natural business to themselves.” The
Colonel’s hands crumpled some papers in a
tense grasp. He paused a moment, as though
to get a grip on himself, then went on. “For
our plant to build the plane that wins the great
Onheim Prize—ah, that would be unexcelled
advertising for us! We will put up the money
and the factory experience to build your model
into its completed practical form. You will
fly it and win the prize. Your model must win—it’s
the biggest idea born in the last twenty
years! The Onheim twenty-five thousand dollars
will be yours! The right to build planes
after your model will be ours, but with a per
cent of the profits coming to you. Do you
agree?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—yes—no—” Hal Dane was struggling
with eagerness and hesitation. “You are more
than generous in your offer. Build the
gyroscope plane and I will fly it for you in
the Onheim Contest—fly it to win for you.
But the Onheim Prize is not what I want—I,
oh,—this is what I want—” Hal pulled from
his inner pocket a ragged clipping. The newspaper
date that headed it was three years old.
“This is what I want to win, the Vallant Prize
for the first non-stop flight across the Pacific—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That,” Colonel Wiljohn rose to his feet,
his face hardening, “that offer ought to be
forced into a recall by the government of this
country. It is a feat, not only impractical, but
impossible of accomplishment. Already the
Vallant twenty-five thousand has lured a number
of our best flyers to their deaths. There
was young Orr, and Jim Hancock, and—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was lack of preparation that killed those
flyers.” Hal was on his feet, too, defending his
most cherished plan, his dream of a great
Western flight. “They tried to do it in a mere
average land plane, over-weighted with nonessentials,
not enough space for extra fuel and
the like. They hadn’t planned and dreamed
an ocean-flight plane for years and years.
Wait, just a moment—” and Hal Dane slipped
out of the office.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he came back, breathless from running,
he bore in his hands the little model of
the long-winged silver ship that had hung in
his room where he could lay eyes on it the
minute he opened his door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is something like what I’d need.” He
laid the model in Colonel Wiljohn’s hands.
“Body cut down to its slenderest, a greater
stretch of wing for speed, but part of the wing
interior could be used for storage purposes to
carry emergency rations, a still to condense
water, extra fuel. I’ve got a lighter engine in
mind too, and higher-powered fuel than any
of the rest used.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For the better part of the night, Hal Dane
and Colonel Wiljohn clashed verbal swords
over the boy’s proposed ocean flight.</p>

<p class='c008'>No matter how well prepared for, it was a
wild undertaking. The Colonel pleaded for
this young flyer whom he had come to love as
his own kin to stay on in America, to put his
talents to work for aviation safety, not for
aviation madness of ocean flights.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the call of the winds was in Hal Dane’s
blood. Even as his ancestors in frail boats
rode the currents of the sea to seek a far continent,
so was the Norse blood in his veins urging
him on to ride the rivers of the wind on
some far exploration.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the end, Colonel Wiljohn gave down before
Hal Dane’s adamant decision.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Boy,” he said, “you win! Fly the safety
model for me at the Onheim Contest, and I’ll
build you the finest plane ever sent out on an
ocean flight—but I fear that ocean flight like
death.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br />ABOVE THE CLOUDS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Boy, you can say ‘Excuse my clouds!’
when you ride that thing, eh?” John Weldon,
master mechanic at the Wiljohn Works,
stepped back to gaze at the strange-looking,
long-winged monoplane that was under construction.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I hope I can say ‘Excuse my fog!’
too.” Hal Dane lovingly touched the aeronautical
board of the plane whereon were featured
the newest devices to safeguard fog
flying.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the place of trusting to any natural horizon
that snow and thick weather all too easily
obliterate, there was set in Hal Dane’s ship an
“artificial horizon.” This was not so immense
as it might sound, but was merely a small instrument
that indicated longitudinal and lateral
position with relation to the ground at all
times. Another innovation was the sensitive
barometric altimeter so delicate as to measure
the altitude of the airplane within a few
feet of the ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>The above instruments were to stabilize the
plane, to keep it to an even keel in flight
mostly. Now came an instrument to help at
landing—the visual radio receiver. This consisted
of two little vibrating reeds tuned to
the radio beacons in use in landing fields. If,
in aiming at a landing, Hal turned to the right
of his course, the right reed vibrated, while at
too much of a left turn, the left reed registered
its little movement. So by keeping the
two reeds in a balancing quiver, he could fly
directly down the path of the beacon to a
landing.</p>

<p class='c008'>True to his promise, Colonel Wiljohn spared
no expense in building Hal Dane the finest sky
boat that ever flew above land or water. Because
the splendid Wind Bird was built for
speed, every surplus inch was pared off—and
yet because of the dangers she must face,
every known safety device was also built into
her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Compared to existing types, the Wind Bird
had streamline qualities of an arrow, of a
needle! Instead of the old complicated gasoline
engine with its exposure of wide air-cooled
flanges butt-heading against the wind,
the new Conqueror-Eisel engine was a marvel
of compactness, and of simplicity. This oil-consuming
Eisel engine was fundamentally
more reliable than the old gasoline engines,
for it was without batteries, and was thus not
dependent upon either an intricate electric ignition
system, or upon a carburetor system
for fuel supply. Separate fuel-injection into
each cylinder assured a dependable and uniform
supply of fuel—thus constituting in a
nine-cylinder, nine individually operated
motors in one. And of greatest importance
for a vast trans-ocean flight, this new engine
could fly a ship one-fourth as far again on the
same weight of fuel as any other engine had
ever been able to achieve. With an Eisel engine,
the great Lindbergh could have flown
to Paris, and then have flown eight hundred
miles farther—all on the same fuel supply!</p>

<p class='c008'>Fuel supply can mean life or death in the
perils of ocean flight. On his ocean flight,
Hal Dane was going to attempt to fly farther
than man had ever flown before.</p>

<p class='c008'>By experimentation, Hal Dane and Colonel
Wiljohn tried to figure out and face every
danger that the boy could be subjected to on
his great flight. They were planning for success,
but no explorer can afford to blind himself
to possible danger—fog, storm, wreck on
the limitless waste of the ocean.</p>

<p class='c008'>Against that dire chance of being forced
down upon the water, the Wind Bird was outfitted
with a dump valve that could drop the
bulk of the fuel load in fifty seconds. Another
protection in case of a wreck on the ocean
was a steel saw that would enable Hal to hack
off the motors and the steel fuselage, and thus
turn the wing into a raft. Within the wing
was a compartment to store emergency rations,
a still to condense water, a water-tight
radio transmitter. Four gas balloons were
to be carried to lift the aerial of this transmitter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Time and again the model of the Wind Bird
was sent up with loads greater than ever the
real Wind Bird would have to carry on the
Pacific flight. During these load tests, Hal
found that he would have to redesign the rudder,
strengthen the fuselage, fit the plane with
stronger axles and wheels.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was a time of proving and verifying
all manner of mechanisms. Continually, the
principal features of both the Wind Bird
monoplane and the strange rotor-bladed gyroscope
were given try-outs on dog planes, as
the test planes were dubbed. And continually,
“bugs” developed on both types of models.
“Bugs” are what the aero-mechanics call those
errors that always show up when air-minded
inventors begin putting theory into practice.
The air is still such an unknown quantity that
when mankind tries to enlarge an air machine
from a tiny model into a great forty-foot wing
expanse, a hundred odds and ends of air
troubles immediately develop. This has always
been the case. Back in those early experimental
days at Kitty Hawk and at Kill
Devil Hill, the Wright brothers had to fight
the error “bugs” that crept into the enlargement
of their models. Those early Wright
gliders that flew perfectly in models scaled to
inches, proved whole-hearted flops when enlarged
to man-sized models. By painful, slow
degrees, the Wrights finally mastered the fact
that in enlarging a heavier-than-air flying
machine, one part can be enlarged to four
times its size, while another part of the same
model may have to be enlarged sixteen times
in order to preserve the air balance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal Dane had the hard-earned knowledge of
the Wrights, and of a hundred other inventors
to help guide him to air truths. Yet, for all
that, his planes were both so radically new in
type that “bugs” all their own had developed
and had to be patiently weeded out. But ambition
drove young Dane harder than any
whips could have driven him. There were
periods when he bent over his drafting table
thirty-six hours at a stretch. The personnel
of the Wiljohn Airlines caught the spirit of
his vast ambition, and during months of construction,
the organization labored as it never
had before. Day and night, seven days a week,
the work went forward. Out of cloth, wood,
and a few lengths of steel tubing grew two
structures that differed enormously. The
gyroscope idea was developing into a squat,
square-looking, heavy-set plane; while the
Wind Bird with its streamlined body and vast
wing stretch seemed to spell speed, speed!</p>

<p class='c008'>In periods when he was not needed for
drafting or supervision work, Hal Dane
slipped away aboard an old plane on some
mysterious journeyings. If the facts were
known, however, one of those journeys was
not so mysterious after all, merely a boy dashing
home to see his mother before he undertook
a dangerous ocean flight. His other secret
missions were flights up and down the
Pacific coast where he was trying for the altitude
that would best speed him off into the
great western river of the winds. From the
data that he gathered, the boy made for himself
strange, wavy-lined maps and charts of
the airways. In addition to these, and based
on nautical tables and on gnomonic and Mercator’s
charts, he plotted out a great oceanic
circle course that was to lead him northwest
from San Francisco, up towards the Aleutian
Islands, on across the Pacific, and in a final
southwest dip along the Asian coast until he
brought the Wind Bird down in Tokio, capital
city of Japan.</p>

<p class='c008'>Work so engrossed Hal Dane that the time
seemed to slip away before he knew it. Here
it was April. A few more weeks would usher
in May and the great Onheim Safety Device
Contest Hal was more than anxious to get
the Onheim Contest behind him. For after
he had flown the gyroscope in that test, he
would feel that he had fulfilled his obligation
to his staunch friend, Colonel Wiljohn,—would
feel free to undertake his heart’s
dream, the Pacific flight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Clutching at Hal Dane’s heart was the black
fear that some other aviator would beat him
to that conquest of the Pacific in the great
non-stop flight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Vallant’s recent offer of an additional
ten thousand dollars was stirring vast interest
in the Pacific Ocean flight. Flyers everywhere
were awakening to the fact that they had let
the huge Vallant Prize go unclaimed long
enough. From across the Pacific, word came
that Sugeroto, that small, lithe Japanese aeronaut
of princely birth, was warming up a
plane for the flight. Two American aces in a
great trimotor were testing out their plane
with the same prize in view. Some ten other
aviators were also reported as planning to get
in the Cross-the-Pacific flight.</p>

<p class='c008'>From his latest expedition into the airways
above the western coast, Hal returned with
jubilation in his heart. Even in the old model
test plane he had taken out, he had ridden far
and fast on a swift and mighty wind river
high above the California sea edge. Young
Dane was wild to be off in his own wide-winged
speed plane, skimming this airpath on
his viking journey across the western ocean
before so much multiple competition achieved
the goal ahead of him.</p>

<p class='c008'>But back at Axion, at the Wiljohn factories,
Hal Dane, instead of coming to his Wind Bird
completed for its try-out, found work everywhere
disorganized. The two near-finished
planes that he had expected to test in two such
different flights, were left perched on their
skids with no hands patiently, carefully building
them on to their perfection.</p>

<p class='c008'>Over radio had been flashed the news that
the whole Three-River district of south Alabama
was under water, that hundreds of
square miles of territory were swept by raging
floods.</p>

<p class='c008'>And Jacky Wiljohn, gone south with his
mother for the winter and early spring at a
resort, was in that flood country.</p>

<p class='c008'>The danger to his beloved idol swept away
from Colonel Wiljohn’s mind every plan for
air-conquest and glory of prize-winning air
models.</p>

<p class='c008'>To Colonel Bob Wiljohn, aviators now had
but one reason for existence—aviators could
act as eyes for the vast rescue army that was
fighting the floods. Aviators could fly over
the torrents to search out the men, women and
children clinging to such land heights not yet
reached by the floods! Aviators could rescue
families huddled on their home roofs that
tumbled and tossed in the muddy currents!</p>

<p class='c008'>The pick of planes and men from the Wiljohn Works
went south for the rescue work.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Wiljohn’s star pilot, Hal Dane, read
the screaming black headlines of the disaster
and the call for help, he answered that call by
pushing glory dreams out of his mind and
going down into that flood country too. The
ship Hal went south in was the dog plane test
model of the gyroscope. That rotor-bladed,
squat-built contraption was going to get its
proving in a real emergency.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch17' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br />FIGHTING THE TORRENT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>To make the trip from Axion down into the
flood-tortured southland without any further
loss of time, Hal Dane set out to fly all night.
He had already signed up with the Red Cross
department in his own city, and had gotten his
instructions. He was to report to Major Huntley,
in charge of the Alabama flooded district,
who would assign him his work.</p>

<p class='c008'>The squat gyroscope had been planned for
safety, rather than making mileage records.
Yet when those limber, awkward-looking
rotor blades began to reach their maximum
of two thousand whirls a minute, why, the
strange craft achieved a speed of near a hundred
miles an hour!</p>

<p class='c008'>Late afternoon had been hazy, with the sun
going down an ominous ball of red. Now as
the night wore on, Hal swept into heavy
weather. Mist changed into a dense, clinging
fog. The wind rolled up into a gale that
seemed to strike from all sides at once. For
safety’s sake, Hal rode high, at something like
ten thousand feet. He had the feeling of a
lone human survivor drifting above a fog-shrouded
world. He must have passed over
hamlets and cities innumerable, yet no glow
of home or street lights penetrated upward
through the fog blanket to point him a guiding
beacon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal’s training in blind-flying stood him in
good stead here, for relying on his marvelous
earth inductor compass and his instrument of
artificial horizon, he managed to keep an even
keel. He held a wary eye to the altimeter,
however, for come fog or come wind, safety
demanded that he ride at a vast height to
avoid a death-dealing crash against some jutting
mountain crag. Three times, the multiple
raging of the gale engendered by the tempest
swinging upward through the gorges, told
Hal that he was crossing mountain ranges.</p>

<p class='c008'>On through the night the aviator drove his
strange rotor, dodging, twisting, tacking, riding
down the wind gusts. Then towards morning
nature seemed to soften and grow milder.
The wind sank to a breeze. Stars came out
just before the darkness lifted for the first
pale pearl-gray of dawn. A rose glow spread
till the whole horizon seemed aflame.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was glorious here, high above the earth,
but as Hal turned his eyes downward a dreadful
view met his eyes. Dismay shot through
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Had his famous compass failed him? Had
winds driven him far off his track? Had he
crossed the whole length of Alabama and the
top of Florida to go drifting like a derelict
above the Gulf of Mexico?</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a sea of water below, a limitless,
shoreless stretch. But instead of white-capped
waves and the clear blueness of the tropical
waters of the gulf, here lay a muddy, ochre-colored
ocean.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the horrible truth swept over Hal
Dane. He was flying the flood! These ugly
waters covered no natural sea bed, but swirled
sullenly above the homes, the villages, the cities
of the southern section of a whole state.</p>

<p class='c008'>All landmarks had been blotted out, but the
aviator got his bearings by compass, and studied
the map he drew from his pocket. This
must be it, the country drained in normal
times by the three rivers, the Conecuh, the
Pea and the Choctawhatchee. But now the
waters followed no separate river beds down
to the sea. Instead they had burst all bounds
and covered the face of the land.</p>

<p class='c008'>He drifted down until he hovered at only a
hundred feet of altitude. From this height
he could clearly vision the astounding panorama
of watery waste.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spires of churches and here and there taller
buildings in a group showing partly above
water told that here lay some town. Straight
lanes of water between the tops of forest trees
meant that beneath the flood a highway ran.
Borne on the yellow tide of the foul, swirling
sea were the dead and swollen bodies of mules,
hogs, horses and cows. Mingling with these
were houses swept from their foundations and
drifting with the current.</p>

<p class='c008'>At intervals, he would catch sight of some
hill or some turtle-backed Indian mound on
whose crest was huddled a village of tents—frail
shelters for the refugees fleeing from the
wild onrush of the flood.</p>

<p class='c008'>Was Jacky Wiljohn found and safe within
one of those tents, or was the little fellow still
out on some half-flooded land ridge or marooned
in some drifting building?</p>

<p class='c008'>Now that he had come and seen for himself,
Hal Dane realized for the first time the awful
magnitude of this peace-time tragedy. Here
was a disaster that equaled pestilence and
battle in its devastation. He had read of these
things—but seeing them was different, more
awful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fog and storm had drifted Hal somewhat
off his course. He consulted his compass, took
his bearings again, and decided that he must
be to the west of Troja, the hill city on the
edge of the flood where were situated the Red
Cross headquarters.</p>

<p class='c008'>He whirled the nose of his plane into the
east. A little later he caught sight of what he
knew must be his destination. Below him lay
a little city whose outskirts were lapped by
the sullen yellow waters. Up in the heights
a whole new city section had been developed
with its streets lined by rows of little army
tents. Some seaplanes lay at rest in a sheltered
bay of flood water. Out on a stretch of
meadow army planes were roped to stakes,
tails to the wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal circled about the field a few times until
he could pick a good landing spot. Then he
cut his motor dead and began to drop. With
outspread rotor blades acting like a parachute,
the curious sky boat with its short stiff
side wings, drifted straightly, gently down
towards earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>By the time Hal settled to his landing, he
was surrounded by a ring of civilians and soldiers
with a sprinkling of keen-eyed, sun-tanned
fellows that he felt were likely aviators.
Some of the crowd guffawed loudly over
the squat, awkward look of the old hen as they
immediately dubbed the odd, square-built machine.
The majority of the men, though, applauded
the unusual feat of the straight-down
drop.</p>

<p class='c008'>A heavy-set, haggard-eyed man in uniform,
who appeared to be the one in authority here,
stepped out and extended a hand in greeting.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal returned the warm grasp. “You, sir,
I’m sure must be the Major Huntley I was to
report to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and you,” the fatigue lines on the officer’s
face were momentarily lifted by a
whimsical smile, “you must be the Hal Dane
our man up in Axion wired us about last night.
His message read, ‘Fellow with the most
curious-looking plane in the world coming
down to help you!’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That just about describes us,” said Hal
with a grin, as he cocked his eye over toward
the old hen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Hal Dane, Camp Number One welcomes
you and your help. That’s a strange
contraption you’ve brought down though.
We’ve had about everything else sent in to
help us—coast guard cutters, steamboats, flatboats,
army planes, navy planes—but never
any such sky boat as that—something new on
me—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Something new on everybody,” said Hal,
“but if it works like we hope, it may be a help
in getting folks out of tight places.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“From all accounts, you flew the whole
night through. Come on up to officers’ quarters
for breakfast and some rest.” Major
Huntley led out in the direction of a row of
tents.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll take the breakfast—the sleep can
wait,” Hal stretched his long legs to the
Major’s brisk stride. “Reckon I’m a good bit
fresher than you folks that have been in this
thing from the beginning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, we’ve all gotten flood-toughened.
There are fellows here that haven’t had their
clothes off in six nights.” Huntley had piloted
Hal to a bench before a long, rough trencherboard
table. While the hot, nourishing soup,
bread and coffee were being ladled out, the
Major went on. “Since you’re willing to keep
on working for the day, we’re too shorthanded
not to accept your help.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal found the men of the officers’ mess a
fine, capable lot of fellows, even if they were
haggard from overwork and their uniforms
all yellow stained and mud caked. Grim days,
grimmer nights of toiling in flood and muck
left no time for dress parade formalities.</p>

<p class='c008'>At his first chance, in a voice out of which
he couldn’t force the tremble, Hal asked
after Colonel Wiljohn. Was he here? The
little Jacky Wiljohn, had he been found yet?</p>

<p class='c008'>Yes, the Colonel was here, a fine old fellow,
doing great work with his crew of aviators.
Too bad about the boy, though! Not a sign of
him and the mother had ever been found. The
big hotel at Malden, just below the forks of
Pea River and the Choctawhatchee was
flooded now, but it had been deserted for days,
everybody had been gotten out in boats early
in the flood. That young Mrs. Wiljohn and
the boy had gone off in a canoe, picnicking, it
seemed, up some little creek the day the floods
had begun to rise. They’d never been heard
of since. Which was something of a mystery,
considering the number of boats and planes
that had combed all sections in a special hunt
for these two.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch18' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br />TO THE RESCUE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Since you are one of the Wiljohn men,”
said Huntley, “I’ll turn you over to the Colonel
for further directions. He’s handling our
aviation fleet with a master hand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When Hal came face to face with his friend
farther down the street of the City of Tents,
he was shocked to see how broken and feeble
Colonel Wiljohn had become. In six days he
had aged a score of years.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hal, Hal—we’ve needed you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I came as soon as I heard, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Might have known you would.” Hal could
feel the tremble of the Colonel’s arm as it lay
across his shoulder. Then the tremble steadied,
and the Colonel went on in a firm voice,
“Well, we’ve work a-plenty for you to do. I’ll
be showing you the ropes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a marvelous organization that Hal
Dane slipped into. He became a cog in a huge,
efficient machine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Over night almost, this flood had come.</p>

<p class='c008'>Over night, also, America organized to save
the people in the flood path.</p>

<p class='c008'>When this appalling disaster broke, the
American Red Cross moved swiftly. At
Troja, Alabama, was set up a special Flood
Relief Headquarters. Here quickly came the
key men of the Red Cross staff from all neighboring
states. To work in liaison, there came
also officers of the Army, Navy, Public Health
Service, Coast Guard, Department of Agriculture,
Veterans’ Bureau and the railroads
which served the flooded area. It was an effective
relief force, equal to any war-time
organization.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a war these men were fighting—a
war against a treacherous, rolling, yellow
flood.</p>

<p class='c008'>From all over the Union came shipments of
food, clothing, tents, medicine. There were
garments to fit any size refugee, from an infant
on up. There were specially prepared
tin cases of food, all ready to be dropped down
by airplane to hill-top refugees, or those marooned
on drifting houses, so as to keep life
in their bodies till boats could haul them off
to safety.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal was surprised to see in the midst of a
supply train standing out in the railroad yard,
a long box car bearing in big letters this striking
sign: “Extra Airplane Parts. Rush to
Three-River Flood District.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The airplane is showing the world what it
can do in times of trouble,” said Colonel Wiljohn,
noticing Hal’s excited gaze upon the
portable aircraft shop on the side track.
“Aviators are the eyes of the Rescue Program,
boy; scout planes fly this blasted flood day
and night, reporting refugees, their exact location,
and the best way to reach them. See,
here come some results now.” He motioned
out towards the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>A square-nosed old river steamer was pushing
in before her a barge loaded with the pitiful,
shabby furnishings of many a humble
plantation tenant home. Over bundles of
bedding, the dogs and children crawled; amid
piles of rickety furniture, tin tubs and hastily
gathered utensils and tools, the family mules
and cows were tethered. On the decks of the
steamer, itself, huddled half a hundred cold,
wet, hungry refugees. The boat was a
weather-beaten old side-wheeler, clumsy and
creaking. But to those refugees, just snatched
from the jaws of death, she probably seemed
the finest ship afloat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Planes came in, other planes took off—an
endless chain of scouts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal was aching to be out on the work.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aviators have to be the ears as well as the
eyes in this flood fighting,” went on Colonel
Wiljohn, “I’m expecting great things of even
this dog plane you’ve brought down, but we’ve
got to get radio equipment installed on it before
you take it out on the job. Radio is our
time-saver. You can wireless a message in
one-twentieth of the time it would take you
to zoom back and forth delivering reports by
word of mouth. There’s an extra seaplane
here, already radio-equipped. You can take
that out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Any kind will do,” said Hal, “just let me
get my hands on the stick and be off.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m changing one group of men to another
section,” went on Colonel Wiljohn, “and the
work I want you to do today is scout-flying in
a ten-mile radius over the flood country below
the forks of the Pea River and the Choctawhatchee.
You’ll have to locate the forks
by chart, that section’s been under water a
week. And Hal, search every creek that leads
in—I—I’m depending on you more than any of
the others—to find—” The Colonel turned
away suddenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal felt a quick sting behind his eyelids. He
choked till he could hardly give his answer.
Without having actually said so, the Colonel,
he knew, was giving him the patrol of the district
Jacky was lost in. If only he could find
Jacky!</p>

<p class='c008'>A few moments later, Hal had become one of
the many aviators whose planes circled over
the heaving waste of flood waters. At low
altitude roared these scout planes. Keen-eyed
as hawks, the flying men sought continually
for groups marooned on ridges or housetops.
In answer to their radio messages flung
into the ether, the rescue steamers churned
far and wide across the yellow tide, hauling
bargeloads of silent, stupefied people snatched
from their perilous retreats. As the work
went on, most of the hill-top islands were
cleared of their refugees, but out of creeks
and bayous, shackly old buildings swept from
their foundations, and burdened with pitiable
human freight, continued to drift down with
the flood current. Scout planes flew low over
these floating derelicts. It would be haggard
faces at a window, or a scream; or, sometimes
it would be a quavery old voice singing a
hymn that told rescuers that here was human
freight drifting down to death.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the beginning of the flood, each drifting
house was, mayhap, searched a dozen times by
various boat crews—no crew knowing that
already others had been there before them.
Time was lost that could have been put to
other needs. To avoid this, it was finally
agreed that when a house was once searched
a red flag, made of calico salvaged from a half-submerged
dry goods store, should be nailed
to its gable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal saw some pitiful sights during his day’s
work. Up Jardin Bayou he found five negroes
on the roof of a tottering barn, the building
ready to collapse and float off. When Hal
dropped them bread from the emergency box
in his cockpit, they hardly had strength to
hold it and eat it. They had been without food
for days, and were so weak that when the rescue
boat came they had to be lifted off into it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of the refugees that Hal radioed word
back about were the four-footed kind. All
through the flooded district, hundreds of
mules and cattle were marooned on ridges and
mounds. These hungry ones soon cleaned
their tiny islands of every vestige of grass,
moss and twigs. After that, they looked starvation
in the face. Hal saw one hungry old
horse, marooned on a bare little mound, who
had the courage to plunge into the roaring
flood, swim a hundred yards to a leafy tree
that lifted its head above the yellow torrent,
eat what waving green he could from it, then
go struggling back to his mound. Such a
courageous one deserved to be rescued. A
radio message brought a barge to gather him
up with a herd of other animals stranded on a
ridge farther up.</p>

<p class='c008'>Midday came and passed. The hours wore
on into the afternoon. The night of flying
across half a continent, combined with the
strain of the work he was at now, began to tell
on Hal’s strength. His head was whirling and
his aching muscles were in rebellion against
the will that drove them on.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then in an instant, a glimpse of a something
lodged in the branches of a drifting tree
spurred him on to fresh endeavors, cleared his
brain of fatigue clouds. Hal was miles from
headquarters, skimming above a section which
had been cleared of refugees earlier in the day.
And now into his line of vision there came
drifting a tree, now and again submerging to
the pull of the currents, and bearing caught
in its branches a tiny figure.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mechanically, his fingers tapped out location
and a call for help. Then Hal began to
maneuver his seaplane for a landing in these
troubled waters. Assistance he knew would
come quickly, but perhaps not quick enough
in this case. If the plunging tree raft with its
lone little passenger was swept into the eddies
just beyond it would be the end.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal brought his plane to water as close to
the forest derelict as he dared. He stood,
braced himself strongly, and hurled a coil of
rope. It hissed through the air and fell over
the leafy drift. At the first throw he caught
only some twigs that the rope knotted about
and he had to jerk it free. The next cast, however,
fell over the body of the child, and by expert jockeying
was finally tightened about the
shoulders. A moment later Hal had drawn
the slight burden to the edge of the seaplane
and gotten it aboard. Like a great bird the
aircraft zoomed up and sped back towards
camp.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Hal landed and came up from the improvised
wharf bearing the child in his arms, it
was pitiful to watch hope blaze in Colonel Wiljohn’s
eyes—then as quickly die, for the child
was not Jacky Wiljohn.</p>

<p class='c008'>But he was someone’s darling. At the end
of a long line of refugees waiting before the
open-air kitchen for their tin pannikins to be
filled with the steaming food, stood a haggard
woman who seemed to have no interest in food
or anything else. With a sudden scream, this
one darted out of line, crying, “Renee! Renee!
My lost child!” as she gathered the little boy
into her arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was far into the afternoon when Hal
paused at the kitchen grounds for a hasty
lunch, his first bite since the morning soup.
He began to realize how weary he was, for
his hand was trembling as he picked up the
big mug of steaming coffee.</p>

<p class='c008'>Radio kept even a rescue camp in touch with
world news. As Hal revived his drooping
spirits with a good, thick hot beef sandwich,
he heard men discussing word that had just
come in concerning the two flyers, Lang and
Munger, who had crossed the continent in
their planes, preparatory to undertaking the
great Pacific non-stop flight. On all sides, argument
waxed hot over this coming event.
Wasn’t there enough land-flying to keep men
busy without all this running into needless
danger trying to fly over the frozen poles and
the oceans? And yet, so ran the other side of
the argument, think of the future of aviation,
the real service these pioneer flights were doing,
the huge money prizes, the glory!</p>

<p class='c008'>After the meal, the flyers that had been out
on flood patrol were snatching a little rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>A dreadful restlessness urged Hal Dane
back into his scout plane. A new savage energy
drove him with the feeling that he must
work till he dropped. He must be too tired
to think. Thoughts were dangerous. The
news that already at Oakland airport, across
the bay from San Francisco, planes were lining
up to compete in the Pacific race, stirred
him terribly, shook the iron control that he
had fought to preserve.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as weather conditions permitted, a
dozen planes would be off on the great flight—and
his plane would not be among them!</p>

<p class='c008'>The time for the splendid Onheim Safety
Device Contest was looming even nearer. Just
a few days to that date now.</p>

<p class='c008'>Prizes could come and prizes could go, but
under the strain of combing the torrent-washed
land for the lost Jacky Wiljohn,
neither Hal nor the Colonel could have time
for thoughts of contests. At least, Hal would
not let his thoughts dwell on the great chance
he’d have to miss. Right now was a time of
testing out a character, if not of testing out a
ship for a prize.</p>

<p class='c008'>Grimly, Hal forced the tremble out of his
hands on the controls, and turned the nose of
his plane out over the rolling ochre-colored
waste of flood waters.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had come perhaps ten miles from Troja
when, out of the wide, flooding mouth of a
tributary creek, he saw a roof top come drifting
into the main rush of the torrent. Hal
flew low, noting it expectantly—any drift
from the creek bottoms might contain those
he sought. His sharp eyes soon showed him,
though, that this derelict had already been
searched. The strip of weather-stained red
calico nailed to the gable told him that much.
But while he still hovered near with engine
muffled to its softest, his ear seemed to catch
a scream—a woman’s scream from within the
drifting house.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flapping bit of red calico signaled, “No
occupant—searchers have been here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That one long-drawn wail still echoing in
Hal’s brain, though, must mean that some
victim of the flood was housed within. There
was the chance that a refugee from floating
logs, or a tree top, had but lately managed to
crawl aboard the half-submerged dwelling.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal noted well the location and the type of
house this drifter was, but instead of radioing
for help, he shot back to Troja in his plane.
At the camp, he sought out Colonel Wiljohn
and told him of the case. All he had to go on
was the fact that this old dwelling had drifted
in from the creek bottoms, and that the sound
of a woman’s scream had seemed to come from
it. Frail grounds for hoping that here might
be Jacky Wiljohn’s mother and the boy himself.
But Colonel Wiljohn squared back his
shoulders; he became all fire and energy in his
preparations. A launch was got ready,
blankets, hot soup in thermos bottles, axes to
break any barriers, ropes.</p>

<p class='c008'>In short order the boat shot out across the
waters, leaving a froth of yellow foam in its
wake.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the drifting, two-story dwelling was
sighted, the pilot cut in close and maneuvered
until he got his craft alongside one of the windows.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal was the first man to scramble from the
boat to the window ledge that was now just a
few inches above the roaring yellow torrent.
As he flung a leg over the sill and slid down
into the room, a scream, like that first he had
heard, greeted him—only terrifically loud, a
wild demoniac scream, followed by a coughing,
snarling roar.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Hal focused the electric torch on the
corner whence came the sound, the beam
blazed upon the wide-set eyes, the tense,
crouched body of a great panther.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch19' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br />WHEN LAND CRUMBLED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>For a moment Hal Dane’s heart seemed to
cease beating.</p>

<p class='c008'>The huge panther was the largest of its kind
he had ever seen. In his scouting above the
flood country, he had now and again glimpsed
a few of these great tawny creatures of the
cat tribe that the waters had driven from their
forest haunts. Out in the open these others
had merely slunk off, hiding from even the
shadow of the airplane that passed over them.</p>

<p class='c008'>But cornered, the panther was a different
beast. He was ferocious, and fought to kill.</p>

<p class='c008'>This one, sides sunken with hunger, flat ugly
head weaving back and forth, jaws snarling
open, crouched tense in its corner.</p>

<p class='c008'>A sudden ague shook Hal’s hand till the
spotlight wavered up and down the walls.
The next instant he controlled himself, held
the torch glow again on the beast before him.
In the space of that instant, the panther had
glided out from his corner. The light flung
into his fiery eyes sent him motionless again—but
how long would the spell-binding of the
torchlight last?</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal Dane moistened dry lips, shaped his
mouth to whistle, and at last forced out a
shrill sound. He had seen steady whistling
charm small animals like rabbits and foxes
into a momentary “freeze”. He prayed, that
it would work now. Dry-mouthed or not, he
must keep up this shrilling ten seconds, twenty
seconds—till his hand could lift his revolver
from its hip holster, till he could take aim.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a six-shooter, but he remembered,
with a chilling to his very marrow, that there
was only one shot left. He had used the other
five picking off rattlesnakes that had seemed
determined to move into the dry haunts of the
human refugees.</p>

<p class='c008'>A sudden switching of tail tip, a lower
crouching of the powerful tawny body, told
that the spring was imminent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Steady! Because the head hung low, he
must aim at the brain through the eye.</p>

<p class='c008'>But before Hal’s gun could belch forth its
one shot, the great beast had leaped. Hal’s
hand flung up to new aim. In the ghastly
white torchlight, a roaring tornado of teeth
and claws rose above him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pistol shot its load straight up. And
that instant, the boy flung himself backwards
out of the window. Instead of landing in a
waiting boat, he plunged into the cold, yellow
depths of flood water.</p>

<p class='c008'>He came up sputtering and choking. But
after the first shock of his submersion, he felt
no alarm. He was a strong swimmer and could
keep afloat for hours if necessary. He bumped
into what he thought was a drifting log, but
it turned out to be a derelict canoe upside
down. He clung to that and shouted. His
electric torch and revolver had been lost as he
leaped from the window, almost under the impact
of the panther’s downward slashing
claws.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal’s lusty shouting soon produced results.
The rescue launch which had drifted down
stream, put about and with its headlight
spraying the water surface with its searching
glare, nosed cautiously back up alongside of
him and his float. Strong hands hauled him
aboard and a warm blanket was flung around
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Colonel Wiljohn was storming up and down
the little craft in a rage at his crew for deserting
Hal in his time of peril.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fellow at the steering wheel was rather
shamefaced over letting a gunshot and panther
caterwauls shake his hand so that the
boat shot from his control and into midstream.</p>

<p class='c008'>“D-don’t blame you,” chattered Hal, drawing
the blanket tighter about his dripping person,
“if it s-s-sounded half as awful to you all
outside as it did to me inside—it was t-t-time
to be leaving!”</p>

<p class='c008'>To make sure that the great panther was
not left merely wounded to suffer lingeringly,
or perhaps to injure someone else who might
enter the place, the boat was drawn again
within sight-range of the drifting old house.
Lights were played over the upper story room,
now so nearly submerged.</p>

<p class='c008'>The long tawny form lay stretched on the
floor, without sign of movement. Hal’s one
shot had done its work.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hope died hard in Colonel Wiljohn’s breast.
His mind told him that the shrill “woman
screams” that had lured Hal to this place could
only have been the panther’s call—so like a
woman crying in distress. To satisfy himself,
however, the Colonel searched every possible
part of the floating, careening old house. With
an axe he forced an entrance through the
warped, swollen doors to the three upper
rooms, searched closets and cupboards. He
found no woman and child hiding away from
that other passenger,—the great, tawny panther
cat. A pitiful litter of clothes, books, a
few small toys, deserted when the home-dwellers
had to flee for their lives, was the
only reward for his search.</p>

<p class='c008'>Back at the camp, Hal experienced all the
comforts of being a “refugee”. Good dry
clothes and a draught of hot milk took the
shivers out of his bones. After his report was
made out, he flung himself down in his tent
to snatch a bit of sleep. With thirty-six hours
of steady strain and flying behind him, slumber
claimed him the instant he hit his bunk.
But tired as he was, he had left word that he
should be called early.</p>

<p class='c008'>Next morning before the sun rose, he was
out on the field warming up the motor to his
strange gyroscope plane. He found the radio
installed. Workmen from headquarters had
done it while he used the seaplane the day before.
Everything was in working order. He
tested the instruments and found that they
were of the best. A few taps and a message
would go speeding through the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even this early in the day, a small crowd
gathered to watch the squat old hen, the newfangled
plane, make its rise. As the rotors
stiffened with their power whirl and the thing
took off, Hal heard a sound of cheering drift
up to him faintly. For all its awkward look,
this thing did rise like a lark on the wing. He
turned her nose out over the flood.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the time being, Hal Dane wanted to follow
out a clew entirely on his own. In the
dusk of yesterday, as he clung to the drifting,
upside-down canoe, and the lights from the
launch had played over it, the name painted
on the battered derelict had seemed to sear
into his brain. The letters had been inverted
and he had read them but subconsciously at
first, then their meaning had suddenly seemed
to burn into his brain in letters of fire.
“M-a-l-d-e-n, Malden”—the name of the hotel
where Mrs. Wiljohn and Jacky had stayed.
This was a boat from that riverside resort.
Malden was miles below where he and the
drifting boat had collided yester evening. So
that meant someone had gone up-river in the
canoe and let it get away to come drifting back
down. That someone could be the Wiljohns.
What had happened to them? Were they alive
after all this time? More likely, dead!</p>

<p class='c008'>It was all too frail a clew to build any hopes
on. Hal could not bear to mention it to Colonel
Wiljohn. He had suffered too much already,
to have another castle of hope built up, only
to have it crash into bitter disappointment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Young Dane flew his craft southward with
the flood to a location he had noted the day
before, marked by a gnarled oak on a ridge
lifting its battered branches slightly above
the torrent. It was near here that he had first
sighted the house of the panther screams.
This big piece of drift and the derelict canoe
must have entered the main flood out of the
mouth of Tanabee Creek—or what had once
been Tanabee Creek. That humble stream
was now a mile-wide torrent, filling a valley.
The overflow from the burst dam at Nelgat
Lake had swamped this broad level.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here the devastation had been terrible. As
Hal pushed farther in this direction than he
had been before, he constantly came upon
sights that taxed his every sympathy. Many
times he saw the bodies of men, women and
children floating with the current. With a
sinking heart, he swept low over those sightless
faces turned toward the sky—searching,
searching, but he had not found them yet.
Numberless dead animals drifted down with
the flood. Shattered homes rocked to and fro
on the pull of currents, followed often by a
welter of broken furniture,—chairs, a baby
carriage, a cupboard that had once held dear
family possessions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Deeper into this desolation he pressed.
About him everywhere, life seemed to have
been smothered out under the waters.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had been flying slowly, searchingly, for
more than an hour, when his hawklike gaze
focused upon a tiny rim of land, a crescent-shaped
island barely showing above the torrent.
The force of currents was eating steadily
at the thin line of land. As Hal watched, a
portion crumbled and toppled into the flood.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then as he swooped down nearer, he
saw to his horror that there was a human figure
on that slender stretch of ground. He
dropped closer, closer, the spread wings of the
rotor above his machine letting him down as
gently as though he hung in a great parachute.
He dropped to a mere forty feet above the
flood, to thirty. He could see a white dress, a
woman’s long hair flung out on the ground.
She was apparently dead.</p>

<p class='c008'>With every moment the rim of land was submerging.
Soon the ravening yellow torrent
would sweep over the last vestige. It seemed
utter folly to risk a life and a plane for one
already dead. Still there might be a flickering
spark of vitality in that still body.</p>

<p class='c008'>No use to tap radio messages for help. No
help beyond himself could reach this doomed
spot in time.</p>

<p class='c008'>He must land on this narrow bit of earth
already crumbling from the wash of the
waves.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under its strange whirl of wings, the gyroscope
plane dropped straight as a plummet.
A deviation to the right or to the left, and aircraft,
aviator and all would have been engulfed
in a roaring torrent without one chance
in a thousand of escape.</p>

<p class='c008'>But his trained eye had measured distances
carefully. In that straight drop he landed
well in the middle of the tiny land crescent,
and where it was least narrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the drawing of a breath, he was out of
the cockpit and running toward the prostrate
figure. Even at the thump of the machine to
earth, that one had not stirred. But now, out
from under a shelter of brush a child came
creeping, a little boy that even this much effort
seemed to exhaust, for he slumped down
weakly.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Jacky Wiljohn!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jacky! Jacky!” shouted Hal Dane, “run
for the plane, quick, while I bring your
mother!” As he spoke, he could feel the rim
of land trembling beneath him, crumbling to
the awful power of the waters.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the child lay where he had dropped. It
was as though his last faint store of energy
had been used in his effort to creep into the
open.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal had already lifted the woman across
his shoulder where she hung limp. He was
staggering under this burden, yet he must add
more. With a quick swoop, he seized one of
the child’s hands and dragging him, took a
few swaying steps forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ten paces, twelve paces! Would he ever
make it?</p>

<p class='c008'>He sagged against the cockpit, slid the
woman in; with another motion he swept the
child in beside her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Like mad, he spun the motor and leaped
for the fuselage as the great horizontal wings
began their first slow whirl.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before him a whole end of the narrow
island broke off and the flood foamed and
roared across the place where land had been
a moment ago.</p>

<p class='c008'>Behind, there was a crash and sound of the
torrent pouring over. Hal could not turn to
look, but he knew what was happening. Earth
toppling into the flood!</p>

<p class='c008'>Would those four rotor blades above him
ever stiffen with enough lifting power for
flight?</p>

<p class='c008'>Within ten feet of the gyroscope’s nose
water poured over the crumbled land edge.
No room for even the slightest run now.
Those rotors must lift straight up with their
extra burden—or it would mean the end.</p>

<p class='c008'>Centrifugal force was whirling the limp
flimsiness of the rotors into an engine of
mighty lifting power. Flexible steel stiffened
as it spun a thousand, two thousand whirls to
the minute.</p>

<p class='c008'>The gyroscope was rising, slowly, not
straightly as it should. Wrong balance of its
burden shifted the take-off climb from perpendicular
to an angle.</p>

<p class='c008'>But at that, it cleared land and rose up and
up into the sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal Dane looked down. It had been a fearfully
close thing. Below him was no island at
all, merely a surging waste of waters where
he had just been. The last of the land rim
had crumbled.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now that he was above it all, his heart beat
to the zooming roar of his rotors.</p>

<p class='c008'>Speed! Speed! He must wing it back before
life force ebbed entirely from those limp
bodies behind him. Already his tapping fingers
had flung the message of his find into the
ether.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch20' class='c009'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br />PRISONED WINGS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the days that followed, Hal Dane plugged
steadily on with his share of the rescue program,
until at last the crest of the flood had
passed and the waters began to recede.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a late supper each night, he paid his
regular visit to the field hospital to see how the
Wiljohns, mother and child, were getting on.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tonight, as he tapped on the board and canvas
door, the nurse stepped out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, the change for the better has come,”
she said, “for a while we thought it was a matter
of hours before life would go. Both had
marvelous reserve strength though, and
they’ve rallied surprisingly—are out of danger
now. But,” and the nurse smiled, “it’ll be
a good while before they’ll be ready for another
such speed trip as you gave them. That
was a wonderful rescue you made, Mr. Dane.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal squirmed uncomfortably. “Just came
in the day’s work. Anybody’d have done it—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nonsense!” A heavy voice boomed in.
“Nonsense, Hal Dane! I’ll tell you for the
tenth time you’re the only man alive that
could have handled that gyroscope, and done
such a feat. Finest thing I ever heard of—finest,
absolutely—” Colonel Wiljohn’s boom
choked suspiciously and he blew his nose
vigorously.</p>

<p class='c008'>The nurse slipped back into the canvas-walled
barracks that housed her patients.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And Hal,” the Colonel had himself in control
again, “Hal, boy, I want you to know that
even in my first selfish grief, I didn’t entirely
forget your hopes and plans. Days ago I
wired to my men at the Axion factories to
speed the finishing work on your two planes,
and to rush them to San Francisco. Our mechanics
will have everything ready for the
demonstration at the Onheim Contest, if you
get there in time. And whether you tackle
that Onheim Contest for me or not, isn’t what
really matters—the main thing is, you’ll find
your Wind Bird ready for you and your great
flight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal’s head seemed to whirl in an ecstasy.
He had suppressed his every longing till he
became a being that snatched a few hours’
sleep, scouted floods with tensed nerves as
long as a shred of daylight lasted, and plunked
onto a cot for a minimum of rest. Now in the
twinkling of an eye, the suppression was off.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the speed he knew how to get out of a
plane, he could be in Denver at mid-morning
tomorrow, and on to San Francisco in the
early hours of that night. After that he could
sleep a round of the clock and still be in time
for the Onheim trials.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of going back in the gyroscope dog
plane that he had brought down and put to
such good use, Colonel Wiljohn turned over
to him one of his speed monoplanes, the fastest
thing that had come into the flood
country.</p>

<p class='c008'>For all of Hal’s feverish haste to be off, delays
of various kinds held him for several
hours. The monoplane, which had seen considerable
service, had to be fueled and
groomed for the long diagonal across more
than half the continent. Friends that he had
made in these grueling times of day-and-night
labor hunted him up to congratulate him on
the work he had put over and to wish him
God-speed for the future.</p>

<p class='c008'>By the time Hal had stepped into the cockpit
of the speed plane, it seemed that the whole
population of Tent-City-on-the-Flood-Edge
had turned out to do him honor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Colonel Wiljohn wrung his hand fervently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your coming down here has been of more
worth to me than I can ever put into mere
words,” he said. “And I only wish I could be
there when you start the great flight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish that, too,” Hal reached a hand down
to his friend.</p>

<p class='c008'>The motor roared, the blocks were knocked
away, and the plane whizzed across the field
and soared into the night sky. The great
shout of the crowd seemed to rise with it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal’s mood was as bright as the moonlit
heavens he sailed across. A hundred miles!
And still another hundred! He was speeding
like some gigantic bird. His instruments
marked a hundred and twenty miles an hour.
He was fairly eating up space.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before midnight he had crossed the Mississippi
waters unwinding like a great ribbon
below the lights of Vicksburg.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then flying slowed down. A dense fog rolled
up about him. The moon was smothered out
above. Below him, disappeared the scattered
lights that meant farm homes and the widespread
glow of city illuminations. He was
alone, shrouded in a gray, dripping world
with only his instruments to guide him.</p>

<p class='c008'>As for direction, he had little fear of going
astray. He was well used to setting a course
by his compass. The chief need was to hold
to altitude so as to clear the loftiest peak that
might be in his path. In the heights he hoped
to find a lessening of the mist, but the damp
grayness was here as everywhere else on this
night.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Hal Dane felt his way on into the night,
eyes glued to the instrument board, there
burst into his senses a sudden roar zooming
through the fog.</p>

<p class='c008'>The roar grew nearer. Another plane was
riding high in the fog, and coming toward
him like a shot out of a shell.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal’s first instinct was to rise higher to slip
over and avoid collision. His hand was on
the pressure, when a quick thought sped like
lightning through his brain—to rise high,
that was natural instinct, that was what the
other flyer would do, of course. There’d be
two riding high, straight to a head-on crash!</p>

<p class='c008'>With a slip of wings, Hal began to drop.
But his reasoning had played him wrong here.
A sound rushing upon him told that the other
flyer, disregarding instinct, had dived also.</p>

<p class='c008'>Through a rent in the fog, Hal had a sudden
awful glimpse of a dark, spreading mass riding
him down. Like lightning, he shot to the
left. In the other plane, another master hand
veered the controls all that was humanly possible.
Instead of crashing into a death grip,
these two mechanical birds of the night slid
by each other with a mere scraping of wings.</p>

<p class='c008'>For Hal Dane, though, that mere scrape
was serious enough. At the shock of the
other’s passing blow, the whole monoplane
trembled, and went limping on into the night
with a bent wing that drooped dangerously.</p>

<p class='c008'>After fifteen minutes of erratic flying, Hal
had to take to ground. The fog had mercifully
lifted somewhat. He coaxed the crippled
plane on to the edge of a rosy glow that meant
a town and landed on the outskirts of this.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal spent the rest of the night in trips back
and forth from the town, in rousting out mechanics,
hunting up tools and repair material,
and in repairing the wing by lantern light.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last he was able to glide up along the
airways again. Instead of humming into
Denver in mid-morning, as he had planned, it
was deep into another night when he finally
zoomed into the airport of that Colorado
metropolis,—turned his plane over to competent
mechanics, and stumbled for sleeping
quarters.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before dawn, he was under way again.
This time luck was with him and he did the
last thousand-mile lap of his journey in less
than nine hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>As it was, he arrived in San Francisco
without even an hour’s space between him and the
great Onheim Safety Device try-out. No time
for any rest for himself, no time for any preliminary
testing of the splendid new gyroscope
plane fresh from the skids of the Wiljohn
factory. All he could do was give a
thorough ground inspection of every part of
this strange mechanism of flight that he had
conceived, and that the Wiljohn factories had
developed with the utmost care. There it
stood—short, fixed wings, sturdy, black-enameled
body, a silvered whirl of gyroscope
wings above the fuselage. The strangest
looking creation for flight man had ever invented!
Strange looking—yes! But if it
worked, it would be man’s most forward step
in safe flying!</p>

<p class='c008'>It was perfect, just as he had planned it,
from its geared motor to its curiously flexible
wind blades. Exultation filled Hal Dane as he
looked on this thing he had created.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was an exultation that was short-lived
though. When he went out to the exhibition
grounds and saw the veritable trap that had
been built for him to rise from, his heart went
cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>Through misunderstanding of the wording
of Colonel Wiljohn’s frantic telegraphic efforts
to get all things ready for Hal Dane’s
flight demonstration, the Wiljohn workmen
had built no platform for the plane to rise
from as had been expected. Instead, they had
built a sort of tower inclosure out of which
the strange new gyroscope was to take its
flight.</p>

<p class='c008'>A white-faced Fuz McGinnis waited for Hal
just outside the door of this tower that looked
like a death trap. He hadn’t seen Fuz for
months now since demonstration flying had
taken McGinnis into half the states of the
Union on Wiljohn business.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two young fellows gripped hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“News of this outlandish tower has spread
like wildfire. I heard about it three states
away, and came to see for myself. And now
that I’ve seen—” McGinnis thumped a
clenched fist against the wooden wall, “I—well,
it’s impossible! You mustn’t undertake
a rise out of that thing. It will kill you. Any
kind of plane has got to have some leeway—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The gyroscope,” Hal protested, “it’s different,
only—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Only this, it would batter you to death in
those four walls!” Fuz began to lead Hal
away.</p>

<p class='c008'>A huge crowd jammed the exhibition
grounds. Word of this new thing, this impossible
flight of an airplane up out of the
mouth of a tower, had spread far and wide.
Men were in groups over the grounds, discussing,
waving arms, arguing loudly. The words
“Hal Dane—Wiljohn—gyroscope!” were on
every lip.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal Dane’s brain seethed. He hardly heard
Fuz earnestly explaining how the affair could
be safely managed—mere change of announcement—rise
from ground instead of
tower.</p>

<p class='c008'>Better to make no rise at all, Hal’s brain
told him dully. After this hurrah of advertised
excitement, a ground rise would be a
flat fall for any interest whatever in the gyroscope.
He was suddenly terribly tired. He’d
been all of a million years without sleep, it
seemed. He’d made a vast effort to get here—for
nothing! Nobody’d be interested in the
gyroscope anymore. And the Wiljohn Works
needed the uplift of that gyroscope success,
had banked on it. Mother and Uncle Tel—what
was he going to do about them? He’d
counted on making them comfortable out of
this success. And now success had slipped
from his grasp—his plans all gummed up by
the foolish mistake of some workmen.</p>

<p class='c008'>Disappointment and weariness were like
some subtle drug, doping him into sleep as he
stood here.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were before the announcer’s stand.
Stupidly, Hal listened while McGinnis made
some sort of explanation to the man holding
the megaphone—all about changed plan, rise
from ground—</p>

<p class='c008'>“No! No!” Hal’s voice was so loud that he
startled himself. “Tell them—just what you’d
planned to say!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He wrenched out of the grasp of the
startled Fuz McGinnis, and sped back toward
the strange tower hangar. Men had already
trundled the limp-bladed rotor machine in
through the wide door at the base. Hal
slipped in, closed and locked that door.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fuz was a true friend, he meant well—but
Fuz couldn’t know what this thing meant to
him. To fail at this would mean he could have
no heart for that dream flight, his exploring
of the ocean airpaths on the wings of the
winds. A failure couldn’t conquer the
ocean! He’d either succeed at this—or die at
it.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Hal Dane leaned against the inner wall
of that tower hangar in which the gyroscope
plane was prisoned, he could hear the excited
voice of the speaker of the day addressing the
crowd through the great radio amplifier that
carried his message to all the throng gathered
there.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It has been said,” the voice of the speaker
rang out, “it has been said that the climax of
aviation had been reached when man learned
to fly as well as birds. For birds most surely
had the lead on man, having flown for something
like twenty million years, while man has
merely tried his wings out during about
twenty years.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Man learned of the birds. He patterned
his flying machine after the principles of bird
flight. He made the ailerons to shift at wing
tip and thus to bank his machine in soaring,
just as a bird lifts its wing tip. He patterned
his light, very light framework after the
bird’s hollow bones. So man learned to fly
like a bird.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But now we are going to show you that
man has learned to fly better than a bird.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Think of the lark, she has to have space
ten times her size to dart forward in before
the lift that soars her aloft.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take the great South American condor
with wing spread of ten feet. Put him in a
twenty-foot pen and you have him a prisoner
for life. The condor needs many times more
than the twenty-foot space for his forward
run before his great pinions will catch the air
and lift him up into the skies.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But man has surpassed the birds. He has
learned to fly, and he has learned to rise without
great space.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Within this restricted tower is man’s
latest achievement, a gyroscope on a Wiljohn-Dane
plane. With no space to dart or glide,
this plane will rise straight up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Would it, oh, but would it?” Hal Dane’s
heart beat ice cold against his leather shirt.
This same type motor had done its duty down
there in the danger of the great Three-River
Flood. It had risen from a tiny knoll, risen
from a crumbling, flood-washed island. Even
though over-burdened with human freight, it
had risen almost straight into the air. But
Hal Dane had been superman, then. Guided
by superpower, he had hurled himself recklessly
into the jaws of death to save life. In
that time of thrilling awfulness, the great
plane had answered to his every touch. Like
some superhuman creation it had shot up from
crumbling death, water death, swamp death.</p>

<p class='c008'>But now, circumscribed by four man-made
walls, wooden, spiritless things that made no
real call to courage or feel of power—now
would this great plane rise, respond to his
will?</p>

<p class='c008'>Not to rise straight up would mean death—a
crashing, roaring piece of machinery battering
against walls.</p>

<p class='c008'>If only there had been a chance to try this
tower out! But there had been no chance for
anything, no chance to think, even.</p>

<p class='c008'>With doom upon him, the young flyer slid
into the cockpit of the squat, heavy plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whir of motor, crazy tipping and swaying
of the machine—then the thrill of power
rushing into Hal Dane’s veins. She was rising.
She was answering his prayer. She was
superbird, four walls could not prison her.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a rushing whirl of her now stiffening
gyroscope wings, the great machine lifted
herself swiftly, steadily; rose in that amazing
space of four wooden tower walls scarce ten
feet distance from her machinery on any side.</p>

<p class='c008'>Straight up—then away over the great,
shouting concourse whirred the plane. Hal
Dane, superbirdman, rode high in the skies,
he swooped, he darted in an ecstasy of freedom
of the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then wheeling, circling till he hung above
the tower with its four walls. He held position
for a long minute, then under control
dropped slowly, down, down, straight into the
maw of the tower.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch21' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br />CALL OF THE WINDS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Like one come back to the present from a
far journey into eternity, Hal Dane sat for a
space within the gyroscope’s cockpit. He
hardly heard the tumult that was men battering
down the locked door to the tower
hangar. Next thing he knew, many hands
were lifting him out of the squat machine that
had made its triumphal straight-rise, and its
equally triumphant down-drop.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fuz McGinnis, red hair on end, eyes blazing
with excitement, was the first to get to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“By Jehoshaphat J-J-Jumping—man, you
did it!” Fuz howled incoherently, “but I
wouldn’t live through another t-t-ten minutes
like that—not to be President, even!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Mr. Rankin, representative of the
great Onheim Prize Fund, was pumping his
hand up and down, “Congratulations, Hal
Dane! The award is bound to be yours.
There’s not the slightest doubt that your extraordinary
performance has beaten every
other safety record set here today. Things’ll
have to be confirmed at headquarters though—will
be letting you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Once Hal was outside the hangar, the surging
crowd pressed close. He was the center
of a shouting, thrilling excitement. Newspaper
men fought their way to him. Questions
were hurled at him thick and fast.</p>

<p class='c008'>Could that thing be counted on always to
rise straight-up, and to sit back down just like
that, behind a wall, or a steeple, or anything?
Hal rather thought it could, considering the
flood test, and now this shooting up out of a
tower.</p>

<p class='c008'>That being the case, did he realize that this
invention was likely to revolutionize the airplane
business? Had he caught the vision of
what the gyroscope could do in the way of
taking off and landing on a mere roof top?
Had he any plans for the now very possible
city-to-be which would have roof-top terminals
on all its down-town buildings?</p>

<p class='c008'>Heavens, how these reporter fellows could
shoot off questions! Hal answered, “Yes, and
yes again, and, well no, he hadn’t drawn any
plans of future cities—he’d been too busy
drawing plans of airplanes—” And then Hal
ducked for cover.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here, Fuz, help me get out of this,” he
whispered, “there’s somewhere else I’ve got
to be, now—right away!”</p>

<p class='c008'>So Fuz had slid into the cockpit of his own
Wiljohn biplane, warmed up the motor, and
held the machine in readiness behind the long
mechanics’ hall near the center of the grounds.
Ten minutes later, Hal Dane entered one door
of this building, went out by another door,
flung a leg over the cockpit, and was in beside
Fuz. In the next moment, he was riding
high above the throng, fleeing from fame, on
the way to the “somewhere else”—and that
was the Mazarin Hangars on the city outskirts.
Here was housed his own plane, his
Wind Bird, that he’d not yet seen in all its
completeness.</p>

<p class='c008'>He felt light of heart, almost giddy with his
sense of freedom. Out there on the exhibition
grounds by his successful demonstration of
the Wiljohn-Dane gyroscope, he had paid his
debt to the man that had most befriended him,
Colonel Wiljohn.</p>

<p class='c008'>As they landed out in Mazarin, a man in the
Wiljohn uniform, who had been pacing back
and forth before one of the low, single-plane
hangars, waved to them, then turned about
and quickly unlocked the wide, sliding doors.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal sped forward in quick, nervous strides,
but paused on the threshold. Now that he
was here, he was almost afraid to look. They
had completed the ship in his absence. Suppose
mistakes had been made, suppose—</p>

<p class='c008'>His heart seemed thundering up into his
very ears, his face was white and strained as
he plunged into the semi-darkness of the hangar.
The attendant slipped in behind him,
switched on wall lights, overhead lights.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A-ah!” It was a long, exultant, in-drawn
breath of ecstasy. Hal Dane stared as though
he could never get enough of looking.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ship—his Wind Bird—she was a
beauty! Slender crimson body, silver wing,
every inch of her streamlined to split the wind
like an arrow!</p>

<p class='c008'>Slenderly beautiful—but what strength
there was here! There was a compactness to
this winged creation that only an exact
knowledge of certain sciences could give. In
the peculiar curved shape of the wing surface
lay the solution to one of the deepest hidden
secrets of flight. The old flat shape of airplane
wings had depended entirely upon air
pressure from below for the rise. The peculiar
curve to the Wind Bird’s silvered wing
would take full advantage of a thrice greater
power—the air’s suction pull from above.
The material in the wing was in itself a
marvel, laminated strata, light in the extreme,
yet almost as tough as iron.</p>

<p class='c008'>Engine streamlined, as well as body! To
the unpracticed eye, the modernistic Conqueror-Eisel
engine might have seemed absurd
in its smallness and its simplicity. But
Hal Dane knew from long experimentation
that in its simplicity lay the fundamental
reliability of this new type engine. He spun
the motor and sat back on his heels to listen
to the smooth gentle hum, music to his mechanic’s
ear.</p>

<p class='c008'>Everything was as he had planned it—great
fuel tank for the high-powered oil he
would burn instead of gasoline, another tank
to hold the liquid, life-giving oxygen he would
need in the heights. The latest life-saving devices
were installed: radio sending and receiving
apparatus, flares, rockets, detachable
compass, and a rubber lifeboat in addition to
those appliances that, in an emergency, could
convert the plane wing itself into a sea-going
raft.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Hal’s plan that nothing that could be
humanly prepared for should be left to mere
chance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The need for such care had already been
driven home to him by the tragic fate of two
of his gallant rivals in this great flight. Just
the day before he arrived in San Francisco,
young Randall and the veteran, Ed West, in
their great trimotor had made their start at
winging the Pacific for the Valiant Prize.
Either overload, or some fault of mechanism
had caused the great plane to fail in a rise
above the cliffs. Both pilot and mechanic had
crashed to death.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jammed throttle had set another competitor
adrift on the sea edge—where, luckily for
him, there were boats a-plenty for the rescue.</p>

<p class='c008'>With these hazards in mind, Hal kept testing
and retesting every part of his equipment
and mechanism. He bunked that night in the
hangar, and with the morning was again at
his work. Terrific coastal rains set in. But
snug within the closed cockpit of the Wind
Bird, Hal joyously challenged the downpour.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the first flight test, the silver and crimson
ship rode the rain clouds with a thrilling swiftness.
For the second flight, loaded with all the
weight that an ocean flyer needs must bear,
the Wind Bird labored somewhat in the rise,
found her speed more slowly. That initial
slowness was a thing that had to be borne
with. Compensation would come in the continuous
quickening of speed as each hour of
flight burned up its quota of fuel, and, degree
by degree, lifted the weight.</p>

<p class='c008'>For two days of rain, Hal continued his
tests. In between periods of work he flung
himself down to sleep like a log, letting nature
repair the nerve strain of that long nightmare
of flood rescue work.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sleep was about his only weapon, too, for
dodging newspaper men. Reporters were
fine, friendly fellows, all right,—but, well, Hal
didn’t want to talk. What he wanted was action,
to be off.</p>

<p class='c008'>All his life seemed to have been leading up
to this one event—his take-off for his viking
flight on the winds of the ocean. And here
was the take-off held up by rainstorm, an
endless one it appeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>Along the Pacific coast, five other flyers
were ready too, awaiting weather conditions
for the great journey.</p>

<p class='c008'>Storm and fog kept Hal Dane on edge for
another twelve hours. Then he decided to
wait no longer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Why couldn’t one take-off in a rainstorm?
No worse than running into rainstorms out
over the waters! On such a journey a flyer
had to face all kinds of weather anyway.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch22' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br />WINGING WESTWARD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>At midnight Hal Dane made his decision.
He snatched a few hours’ sleep. Then in the
early dawning he went out to inspect the
Mazarin Field runway. Not so good—ground
wet and heavy with days of drenching rain!
But as the downpour seemed scheduled to continue
indefinitely, things could only get worse
instead of better. So—well, it might as well
be now!</p>

<p class='c008'>In spite of the foreboding, heavy weather,
Hal Dane’s heart was light. The past days of
indecision had sat like a burden upon his soul,
and now that his mind was finally and firmly
made up, he suddenly went ecstatic, happy beyond
all measure.</p>

<p class='c008'>He caught himself whistling as he gave his
plane its last thorough looking over. It seemed
to be in perfect shape. Whew! What a beauty
it was! He slid an affectionate hand along its
polished length as the men trundled it out into
the field. There he slung aboard his provisions
and water, climbed in and gave the signal for
the blocks to be knocked away.</p>

<p class='c008'>The motor roared and the plane started
down the runway.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wish I were going too,” yelled the red-headed
McGinnis as he raced alongside.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wish so—” Hal’s words were lost in the
thud of the motor. The machine labored forward,
gathering speed slowly. Wet, muddy
ground and the last load of fuel seemed to
have rooted it to earth. Would it never rise?
Was this splendid attempt to meet disaster in
the very beginning?</p>

<p class='c008'>At last the heavily-loaded Wind Bird began
to lift gallantly, rose to barely clear the tree
line, then zoomed up into the sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even at this unearthly hour, a horde of
spectators milled on the ground below, their
hearts’ hopes rising with this brilliant attempt
of young Dane. For the young fellow, the
shyest of heroes, who had run away from his
first taste of fame, had overnight fired the enthusiasm
of the whole nation.</p>

<p class='c008'>As though lifted on the shouts of the onlookers,
the lone flyer in his Wind Bird took
the air and went up, up into the heights.</p>

<p class='c008'>He leveled out for a while to get speed, then
rose another thousand feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal Dane had taken off at a little after six
o’clock in the morning, and he had headed out
with his back directly to the rising sun—or
at least with his back to the place where the
sun would have been seen rising if the cloud
banks had not hidden it.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a few moments, the skyscrapers of San
Francisco, looking white and spectral, were
swallowed up in the gray-brown pall that enshrouded
the Golden Gate. Hal’s last picture
of them was of mere tower tops that seemed
to hang like a magic city in the clouds. A
forerunner this, of the mirages he was to encounter
later on, when magic cities would
seem to rise before his tired eyes, then crumble
away among the clouds.</p>

<p class='c008'>Below him swept an immensity of ocean,
the color of ashes in the misty haze. Nowhere
was there any mark to guide him. From now
on he must rely entirely upon his instruments,
and Hal began to keep a wary eye upon his
inductor compass.</p>

<p class='c008'>That compass was the most remarkable of
all the splendid equipment features of the
Wind Bird. It was based upon the principle
of the relation between the earth’s magnetic
field and the magnetic field generated in the
airplane. When the plane’s course had been
set so that the needle registered zero on this
compass, any deviation would cause the needle
to swing away from zero in the direction of
the error. Such an error could be corrected
by flying the plane with the needle at the same
distance on the other side of zero, and for the
same time that the error had been committed.
This would set the aircraft’s nose back on her
course again.</p>

<p class='c008'>When well out over the ocean, he took calculations
and set his course due northwest.
He was figuring on covering the ocean in a
crescent-shaped sweep that would have the
advantage of sighting the Aleutian chain of
land points at better than midway, and it was
a course that he hoped would send him well
within the range of certain air currents.</p>

<p class='c008'>As his course steadied, the roar of his ninefold
engine assumed a pleasing grandeur, like
music flung out over these far spaces. The
motor was working to perfection, humming
along under its mighty load. It was a comfort
to know too that every pound of fuel burned
meant a lightening of the weight and an added
capacity for speed, more speed.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a flare of fire, the sunlight burst through
the gray world of clouds. The rainstorm was
lifting. Weather conditions that had frowned
so on his take-off were changing to a golden
glory to speed him onward. But Hal Dane
knew all too well that this fickle glory of sunshine
could change back to black thunderheads
in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p class='c008'>To the right of his plane, he caught a
glimpse of a faint dark blurred line. That
could be the west coast, the land of America
that he was speeding away from now in a
northwestern diagonal.</p>

<p class='c008'>Was this blurred glimpse all that he’d ever
see of land again? Who could tell? He might
land safe on those other shores, and again, a
hundred different causes could crash his gallant
sky ship into the gray waves, to sink
eventually to the ocean bottom.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal squared back his shoulders, lifted his
head. He would force dark thoughts out of
his mind. There must only be room in his
plans for hope.</p>

<p class='c008'>He sent the throttle up a notch. More
speed! His heart caught the lift of power
from the throbbing motor. Exultation, and
the wild spirit of the Vikings surged through
his veins. His Norse ancestors had crossed an
ocean in a frail sea skiff. And now he, like
some atom adrift in the immense wastes of the
sky, was daring the air currents on man-made
wings. Hal Dane felt a thrill of power and
glory shoot through him. It was speed on to
whatever the end was, to death, or to victory!</p>

<p class='c008'>For this longest of long distance flights
where every extra pound counted against success,
Hal had stripped his plane to the barest
necessities of weight in food and equipment.
Then at the last minute he had carried things,
light as air, yet weighty in a certain kind of
content. God-speed telegrams from his
mother, from the faculty of his old flying
school, from Colonel Wiljohn! There was
also a yellow slip of telegraphic paper bearing
him congratulations and word that his
gyroscope had won the Onheim Prize. The
hopes and thoughts of his friends were going
with him on this wild venture.</p>

<p class='c008'>All unknown to him, the thoughts of a nation
were following the Wind Bird. A ship
that had glimpsed a flyer going up coast had
radioed word back. Other messages swept
through the air from a far-out fishing fleet
where the lone flyer crossed human sea trails
again. This word was bulletined in theaters
and picture show houses, was on a million lips.
Wind Bird had gone thus far. How was
the weather? Could he make it?</p>

<p class='c008'>At midday the lone flyer checked up position
and headed out over the Pacific in a more
westerly direction. Far to the north of him
would be situated Sitka, behind him should
lie Vancouver—it was in this air range that
he, on preliminary explorations, had located
a great current of the wind that flowed west
in the heights.</p>

<p class='c008'>If he and the Wind Bird could efficiently
ride this current it would mean speed such as
he had heretofore only dreamed of, would
mean time and fuel-saving in the great Trans-Pacific
crossing.</p>

<p class='c008'>In preparation for his chill rise up into the
earth’s stratosphere, or upper air, Hal Dane
snugly closed the throat of his heavily padded,
leather-covered suit of down and feathers.
Fur-lined moccasins over his boots, and a
leather head mask lined with fur, which with
the oxygen mask entirely covered the face,
completed the costume. His goggles had already
been specially prepared with an inside
coating of anti-freezing gelatine, supposed to
prevent the formation of ice to minus sixty
degrees Fahrenheit. Ice on the inside of the
goggles would be a temporary blind, as Hal
well knew.</p>

<p class='c008'>Worse than the terrible cold was the lack of
oxygen he would have to combat up in the
heights of rarefied air. But a marvelous artificial
aid had been prepared for this also. In
the Wind Bird was installed a special oxygen
apparatus that could furnish him a strong
flow of life-giving gas through a tube adjusted
to the mouthpiece of his helmet. With
minute care, Hal examined every section of
his two separate systems of gaseous oxygen,
the main system, and the emergency system.
He wanted to be very sure that nothing was
left to mere luck. Other men before him had
ridden high. But today, he must ride the highest
stratosphere if he were to really explore
the vast speeding wind river that his other
searchings had merely tapped.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal Dane began to climb. By degrees he
forced the Wind Bird up, the curved vacuum
of her specially-built wing meeting the air-pull
from above to aid in a mighty lifting.</p>

<p class='c008'>Up he went in great sweeping spirals, ever
mounting higher and higher, the engine of the
Wind Bird working beautifully. The altimeter
told him he was at the height of seventeen
thousand feet,—now he had reached
eighteen, nineteen, twenty thousand! His
ship was still climbing, acting beautifully.
But he, Hal Dane, was not acting right. In
the face of triumph, his whole sky world went
suddenly gray and dreary, he felt a queer
lassitude, and a slowing up of faculties.</p>

<p class='c008'>The oxygen! In the excitement, he had forgotten
to draw on it!</p>

<p class='c008'>With a languid movement, he thrust the
tube into his mask. A few deep breaths and
his gray world brightened. More oxygen,
more,—and he had changed back into his old
self, ready to think and act quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now he was entering into a favorable wind
that sped him in the rise. He went to thirty
thousand feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thirty-four thousand! Thirty-five! Thirty-six!</p>

<p class='c008'>The cold was now intense. For all his
furred garments, there was no shutting out
the frigidity. It ate to the very marrow. But
Hal Dane’s heart was hot within him, burning
in its thrill of exultation. He was riding
thirty-eight thousand feet above the earth,
and riding with the whizzing speed of a bullet
shot from a mighty gun. His plane, capable
of two hundred miles an hour, had slid into
a two-hundred-mile wind here in the upper
air, and it was hurtling forward at the appalling
speed of four hundred miles per hour.</p>

<p class='c008'>Speed—speed! Hal Dane’s heart throbbed
hot and wild. He was riding faster than ever
mortal rode before, swooping before the mad
currents of the river of the wind. The crossing
of the great Pacific will now be a matter
of hours—not a matter of days. And his the
Viking sky boat that first dared the fierce
gale of the wind path!</p>

<p class='c008'>The gale he was riding gathered power. His
speedometer mounted erratically, jerking up
records of additional fives and tens of miles.
Ten—twenty, thirty—four hundred and forty
miles per hour.</p>

<p class='c008'>A curious vibration of his engine startled
him. But he drove away all thoughts of danger.
The mileage was a magnet that held his
eyes. Speed, speed! Riding high and fast!
The sky was his height limit. He was reeling
off a record. He must hold to it, must speed
on.</p>

<p class='c008'>Riding higher and faster than any human
since creation! Thrilling thought—thrilling
thought—thrilling thought—his head was
knocking queerly. He leaned forward, and
the instruments in the cockpit became dim and
shaky. He was drifting into a semi-delirium
from which he could not seem to rouse himself.
His mind refused to focus upon what it
must do.</p>

<p class='c008'>His dulling senses caught a thud-thud-thud!
Engine vibration so great that it seemed the
machine must tear apart!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch23' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br />FIGHTING DEATH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Even the exertion of leaning forward,
slight as it was, proved dangerous in the abnormal
condition the high air produced in the
human system. In that instant of stooping
forward, Hal Dane lost consciousness and fell
with his plane, like a plummet, through the
thin air.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rarefied state of stratosphere was as
dangerously violent against the human-made
air machine as it was to the human body.
Despite oil emulsions on the wings, up here
in this terrible cold, ice formed with deadly
quickness on every part of the machine. In
an instant, the plane was covered all over in
a frozen layer an inch thick. Ice formed continually
on the propeller, and was as quickly
thrown off in terrible vibrations that near tore
the motor mechanisms asunder.</p>

<p class='c008'>And young Dane, a modern Viking who
had dared ride the uncharted skyways, hung
limp across his belt strap. The insidious
treachery of the upper air had taken him unawares
and hurled him into unconsciousness
in the midst of his triumph of speed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The life-giving oxygen was there in its
tube, at his very lips, but here in this dangerous
light-air pressure, Hal had not been able
to assimilate all the oxygen that he needed.
The human lungs, built to take in the amount
of air needed at ground levels, had balked at
having to take in five times the usual volume
as was necessary in the heights of the stratosphere.
And all in an instant, the exhaustion
of air-starvation had claimed the flyer as its
victim.</p>

<p class='c008'>Down and down shot the plane, wallowing
in the air troughs like some dismasted ship
in a sea wreck.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now, choking, hanging limp and unconscious
though he was, Hal Dane began to
faintly breathe in the blessed heavier air of
the lower altitudes he was hurtling into.</p>

<p class='c008'>Back from the heights he slid, back into
normal air pressures. He shot ten thousand
feet while the struggle for breath and for consciousness
held him. Longer and deeper
breaths he drew at the tube, and the oxygen
gradually began to restore his strength.</p>

<p class='c008'>As control of self came to him, he straightened
back into position and fought to bring
his mad ship to an even keel.</p>

<p class='c008'>Below him lashed the hungry, growling
wastes of the Pacific. As he plunged wildly
downward it seemed that the ocean depths
would swallow up the twisting, turning plane
before it could gain its equilibrium.</p>

<p class='c008'>On he came, diving, stalling, slipping—flattening
out at last in a long lightning quick
swoop above the waves.</p>

<p class='c008'>With nerves in a forced steadiness and
hands like steel gripped to their task, Hal had
checked the meteoric fall and had regained
some measure of control over his craft. Now
when he dared relax, he found himself, within
his furred clothing, dripping wet in a horror
sweat. In a brief ten minutes of life he
seemed to have tasted every extreme, heat,
cold, rising, speeding, falling.</p>

<p class='c008'>In his fighting back to level out, he had
dipped out of his course—his earth inductor
compass told him just how far a dip he had
made, and he traveled in a swing to the other
side until the needle was again at zero.</p>

<p class='c008'>Riding the normal airpath above the ocean
at an average clip of round about a hundred
and fifty miles the hour seemed safe and slow
after that life-and-death race high up in that
stratosphere layer above the earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the afternoon wore on, Hal twice again
mounted high into thin air and rode the
winds for a brief space, each time coming
down before exhaustion could quite claim him.
Risky as these performances were, they were
undertaken in no mere daredeviltry of spirit.
Instead, it was for experiment’s sake that Hal
Dane repeatedly dared the weird dangers of
the stratosphere’s violence of wind and cold.
He wanted to prove to himself that his newfound,
splendidly dangerous river of the wind
flowed always into the west. For already he
was dreaming of a plane built to more efficiently
take advantage of this great aerial
current.</p>

<p class='c008'>For all its careful designing, his present
Wind Bird could not steadily ride this high,
cold aerial river. There were certain necessary
points of construction that needs must
be considered in flying craft for the high, thin
air strata. Hal Dane’s heart leaped to the
thrill of what he was learning. Those great
aerial currents had half battered the life out
of his body, but from his terrible contact with
them, he had wrested secrets to carry back to
the builders of airplanes.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Hal Dane skimmed the ocean surface at
a steady, rhythmic gait, his mind leaped ahead
to future aircraft building that should utilize
the knowledge that he had gained by his
stratosphere explorations. He had found
that the human body, fashioned to thrive in
an air pressure of something over fourteen
pounds per square inch, could suffer intensely
when lifted to a rarefied air pressure of
merely two and a half pounds to the inch.
But since man had been smart enough to lift
himself on wings above the clouds, why, now
man must be smart enough to lift his normal
air pressure with him. This could be done,
Hal believed, by making the plane’s cabin of
metal, hermetically sealed, and equipped with
oxygen tanks to maintain the same air pressure
as at ordinary altitudes.</p>

<p class='c008'>From long practice, Hal’s hands mechanically
shifted gear in the speeding plane, to
hold to an even flight, while his mind wrestled
continually with the many problems that even
his brief taste of stratosphere flying had
opened up to him. On future “high flyers”,
the sealed cabin would necessitate the working
out of some method of absorbing the
gases given out by the breath. Then, too, the
ordinary systems of controls could not be used,
as they would necessitate holes in the “sealed
cabin.” Ah, he had it!—electric controls could
be devised to govern rudder, elevators, ailerons.
This great power could be used to fight
the terrible high air cold, also, and electrical
heating would keep the deathly dangerous ice
sheath from coating wings and—</p>

<p class='c008'>With a startled gasp, Hal Dane swung from
dream planning back into reality, in bare time
to hurl his ship upward out of a strange danger.
Beneath him, the ocean surface rolled
into a monstrous heaving, and a waterspout
shot upward, barely missing his wing.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch24' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br />NIGHT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>At his swift touch, the plane reared upward
and away from the danger that was rolling
and heaving directly beneath. Peering out
of the window at his left, Hal saw in the
waters a procession of monsters. In the dusky
haze of the twilight, a great school of whales
were disporting themselves in hugely fantastic
leaps and lunges. When a sixty-foot
whale would leap high in the air, then drop
its tons of weight back down against the
waters, it seemed that creation shook to the
concussion. At the thunder of huge bodies
smashing back through the waves in their
enormous fantasies of playfulness, Hal sent
his ship rising higher into the air. If one of
those monster bodies even brushed his wing
or rudder, it would mean his plane crushed
into helplessness, himself adrift upon the
ocean.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the approach of darkness, Hal Dane’s
spirit seemed to reach its zero hour of loneliness
and weariness. Since the dawn of day he
had matched his strength in battle after battle
with the varying phases of the elements. He
and his frail wind craft, mere contraption of
cloth and wood and some lengths of steel tubing,
had come out victorious so far—but there
was still the night ahead of him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He realized with a start that he had not
tasted food for more than twelve hours.
Even now, he felt no hunger; the long strain
of matching human wits and power against
the winds had taken away his appetite.
However, he required himself to eat a sandwich
and drink some hot coffee from his
bottle. This would help him keep up his
strength. He needed that help for strength.
The darkness he was entering was a worse
monster than those vast thrashing whale
bodies he had just escaped.</p>

<p class='c008'>Loneliness entered the lists against him
also. As far as he could see over all the great
ocean stretches, there showed no tiny pin
point of light that could be a great transoceanic
steamer cruising onward with its vast
burden of human lives. If anything happened
to him out here in the night, he was all alone,
no vessel near to come to his assistance, no
help outside of himself. If he died, he died
alone—a mere atom dropped down in the
ocean depths.</p>

<p class='c008'>With an effort, Hal forced his mind away
from morbid thoughts. He concentrated on
his maps and instruments. Already, he had
come over two thousand miles. With every
whir of his motor he was ticking off more
miles. A great longing rose in him to ride
the high air currents once again, that would
mean real speed. But he dared not risk his
plane another time in the icy grip of the
stratosphere. He had wracked the engine
enough already. Another such battle with
the ice sheath and with over-speed might tear
the motor bodily from the machine.</p>

<p class='c008'>To add to the loneliness of the night, he now
swept into a stratum of fog. It hung in an
enveloping mass about the ship, creeping into
the cockpit, clouding the instruments. As Hal
rode high to avoid the fog, he swept into an
area of black clouds, snow clouds. At this
altitude, he found the air filled with hail. In
a moment these heavy, dangerous ice pellets
were rattling angrily against the plane. Like
a hunted creature, Hal shot this way and that
striving to dodge the zone of ice and sleet.
It was no use; the ice pall pursued him, sheeted
his ship. Wing surfaces were flung out of
balance with additional weight, controls began
to clog. There was nothing to do for it
save drop back down into the warm, foggy
layers of air just above the waves. As soon
as he hit the warm zone, ice began to melt,
its heavy, retarding weight slid off. The
speed of the ship, which had lagged below
eighty miles the hour, now began to zoom back
up well over the hundred mark.</p>

<p class='c008'>His instruments would hold him to his
course, and the noctovistor installed on his
plane would catch the red glow of any ship’s
light, even through the fog, and warn him of
its presence. But unlighted derelict ships
adrift on the sea, and floating ice peaks were
dangers that the red eye of the noctovistor
could not record. His luck, alone, could carry
him past such of these that happened in his
path.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later in the night, a glow on his noctovistor
told him that a ship lay ahead. Hal sped sufficiently
out of his course to avoid any danger
of collision. Out through the air, though, he
began flinging radio messages, and soon
picked up a reply. From this ocean liner he
got confirmation of his exact location, and the
time. Brief enough messages they were, but
Hal Dane blessed the wonderful science whose
marvels had put him in touch with other humans
out here in the lonely stretches of the
great ocean. He zoomed on into the night
with his heart cheered by this brief contact.</p>

<p class='c008'>He now winged his way out of fog and
cloud into the white light of the late rising
moon. Now and then in this silver glow,
mirages swam into his view. Peaks, foothills,
ravines and rivers were etched so boldly in
the sky that they seemed almost real. Fantastic
hills and valleys would crumble away,
and others equally fantastic would rise to take
their place.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then dawn began to break. Streaks of
light crept up behind him out of the western
sky. Below him, land appeared, islands dotting
the ocean in a long crescent dipping
northwest. Land—was it real, or merely
another mirage? He flew lower. It was, yes,
it must be real. There were houses, men like
tiny dots, and a fleet of fishing craft that
seemed mere toys, was setting out to sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the far-flung land chain of the
Aleutian Islands that he was crossing. With
a queer thrill in his heart, Hal Dane looked
down over the side of his ship. Below him
was real earth. He could land here if he
wanted to, be in the midst of people. Right
here he could end the long loneliness—if he
wanted to.</p>

<p class='c008'>Resolutely, Hal kept his plane headed
forward. According to his charts he must turn
slightly to the south now for the last south-western
curve on his crescent-shaped route.</p>

<p class='c008'>The longest stretch of ocean flight was over
now; he felt that he had conquered the worst.
In less than twenty-four hours he had come
over three thousand miles—nearly three
thousand, five hundred, in fact. At this rate
he ought to sight the island kingdom of Japan
in the afternoon of this day.</p>

<p class='c008'>But in his reckoning, Hal had not taken into
account the treacherous weather of the northern
reaches of the Pacific. Instead of making
good speed on this last lap of his journey, he
began to lose time, to drop behind on his carefully
worked out schedule.</p>

<p class='c008'>From now on, he swept along in a continuous
storm area. Gales seemed to roar up
from nowhere and burst about the plane.
From his student weather studies, that now
seemed part of a long-gone past, Hal Dane
had learned much about the thunderheads and
twisters of the atmosphere. He knew a deal
about gauging the breadth and diameter of
certain type storms, their speed of movement,
the velocity of the winds within these storms.
Every shred of such knowledge that he had
was put to severe test now. In his plane, he
was like some hunted wild animal fleeing before
the storm hounds, turning, twisting, riding
now high, now low. Time and again he
was only able to avoid a crash by feeling his
way around the edges of the storms and dodging
between them, never letting his plane become
completely swallowed up in the maw of
the storm monster. Sometimes two or three
storms came together. A low-powered airplane
would have been lost for lack of force
to make headway in such a case, but the
mighty Wind Bird courageously battled forward
on these constantly changing air currents.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the clouds shredded away, and the
glow of the evening sun lit the sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal Dane relaxed in his seat. He had
fought a long fight, had lost all reckoning of
time, space, of ocean distances. He had flown
far enough to be near land—of that he was
sure.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon he had confirmation of his hopes. His
plane swooped into the midst of a flock of sea
gulls. These winged fishers of the air often
flew hundreds of miles from shore—but the
sight of them usually meant that shore was
somewhere in the distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Right enough Hal was in his deductions.
Soon after he had passed through the gull
fleet, he glimpsed tiny dots dipping on the
waves below him. He flew lower. It was as
he had hoped, these dots were men out in their
fishing boats. Soon a shore line came into
view.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the Viking of the Sky swooped low
over this land, however, the thrill in his heart
changed to dire foreboding. He had come far
enough to land in Japan—but this was not
Japan, land of the flowery kingdom. Those
squat fishermen below wore primitive, furred
garments. Instead of pagodas and quaint
paper-walled dwellings of the Japanese, here
crouched a squalid village of round-roofed
mud huts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Storms had sent him far out of his course.
Instead of Japan, this was Kamchatka that he
floated above. Away to the south of him lay
the Tokio of his destination.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the face of a terrible weariness that was
creeping over him, Hal Dane turned the nose
of his craft to the south. He had already
spent one night out over the ocean, and now
another night was darkening his sky.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch25' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <br />HIS NAME ACROSS THE SKY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Deep in the night, and in a dense fog, Hal
Dane hovered over a faint earthly glow that
he felt must be Tokio, capital city of Japan.
Hours ago he had straightened the wide deflection
of his course that had taken him
astray over the edge of the long peninsula of
Kamchatka.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he checked up again by chart and map,
his wearying senses told him this must be it—the
Tokio that he had crossed thousands upon
thousands of miles of ocean to reach.</p>

<p class='c008'>He drifted down to four thousand feet altitude.
From here flood lights and beacons
were dimly visible, more assurance that he
must be over the imperial city of the Orient’s
most progressive civilization.</p>

<p class='c008'>A thrill shot through Hal Dane, lifting the
great weariness of the forty hours’ continuous
flying. Aches and chill and battering of
storms were forgotten now that the fight was
ending. He had done what he had set out to
do—crossed the greatest of the oceans in a
single non-stop flight.</p>

<p class='c008'>His fingers began to tap an incessant query
on his sending-radio outfit, “Landing field?
Landing field? Landing field?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And suddenly he was in touch with answers
winging their way up to him from the ground
below—“Tokio Asahi! Tokio Asahi!” Over
and over he got those two words—“Tokio
Asahi!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was in touch with humanity again! Men
on this Japanese land knew he was winging
his way above them. Men were answering his
call. “Tokio Asahi”—there it came again.
What did it mean?</p>

<p class='c008'>His radio was bringing him words, but they
meant nothing to him. His only comfort lay
in the fact that men knew he was here in the
air, and that probably they were making some
preparation for his landing.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seemed to him that now a glimmer of
flares burned brighter in a certain spot. He
hoped these marked a landing field, hoped also
that radio landing beacons would be here to
respond to the visual radio receiver on his instrument
board.</p>

<p class='c008'>Down he came in long sweeping circles,
seeking a place to land. A wrong landing
could mean death, not only to him, but to
hapless ones he might crash upon down there
on the fog-blanketed earth. For dreadful
sickening seconds, apprehension rode him.
His heart seemed clutched in iron fingers, his
face was white under the strain as his eyes
watched the instrument board.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ah! they were quivering—those two
strange little reeds that by their vibration told
the good news of radio beacons waiting down
there to help him make his landing. With a
joyous surge of relief in his heart, Hal Dane
began his long, slanting, final downward
plunge. An over-quivering of the left reed
told him that he was diverging too much on
that side. With a quick swerve of the airplane,
he put both reeds back into a balancing
quiver, and thus followed their direction
straight down the path of the beacon to a
landing.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had landed! He was in Japan!</p>

<p class='c008'>The young flyer had been so engrossed in
blind flying to a perfect landing by instruments
alone, that it came as a shock to him to
look out of his machine’s window and see the
huge crowd that awaited him on this Oriental
landing field. The throng had scattered somewhat
to make room for the ship’s downward
plunge.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal Dane thrust a blond head out of the
window. “I’m Hal Dane,” he said simply, “in
the Wind Bird. We—we made it, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At that, the crowd swept in. They had no
more idea of what he was saying than he had
had of their “Tokio Asahi” that had been
radioed up to him. But the boy’s smile and
his quietness of manner had won them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Radios had been busy for two days in
Japan, as well as in other parts of the world.
From the time Hal Dane had left America,
radio had winged its messages back and forth
to various parts of the civilized universe.</p>

<p class='c008'>The phenomenal courage of a boy alone
flying the greatest ocean, had stirred the heart
of Japan. And now that Hal Dane, Viking of
the Sky, had made his landing, Japan set him
high on her throng’s shoulders.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a shouting, laughing, good-natured
crowd, gay with the colors of Japanese girls’
sashed kimonos mingling with the black of
more sedate native costumes, and with the
trim modern uniforms of Japan’s host of
young army flyers.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the first wild rush, the plucky American
aviator was fairly mobbed. The shouting,
howling throng, wild with joy and excitement,
hauled him clear of his plane. Everyone
wanted to shake his hand, American fashion,
or even just touch the garments of this one
that had flown the skies. Trim, sturdy members
of the imperial air force, got to him,
lifted him upon their khaki shoulders. Thus
he was borne through the streets of old, old
Tokio where the automobile and the jinrikisha
mingled as unconcernedly as did the old-time
temples and tea shops mingle with eight-story
skyscrapers and picture theaters.</p>

<p class='c008'>Behind him, edging the landing field, rose
a fine modern building. Hal Dane waved an
inquiring hand at it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tokio Asahi!” came the surprising answer
that was shouted from many throats.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hal nodded his head as if he understood,
but puzzlement seethed in his brain. What
did this queer shout mean that greeted him
everywhere, even met him in the air before
landing?</p>

<p class='c008'>As the triumphal procession made its way
down the street, newsboys, carrying bundles
of papers, tore through the swarming crowds,
ringing bells, flying small flags, and shouting
loudly as they waved these “extras” just off
the press.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their shout floated back to Hal with an
irritatingly familiar refrain, “Tokio Asahi!
Tokio Asahi!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And suddenly, from his perch on men’s
shoulders, that lifted him hero-wise above the
crowd—Hal Dane burst into boyish laughter.
He had it, that “Tokio Asahi,”—it was the
name of Japan’s greatest newspaper—the
newspaper with over a million circulation,
and with a most modern of modern air mail
deliveries. That was evidently the Asahi’s
own great landing field he had arrived above,
so naturally it was the name Asahi that had
been radioed up to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Well, the Asahi was certainly an up and
coming publication. As young Dane peered
down from his place at the second army of
newsboys speeding with flag and bell advertisement
through the mob, he saw with astonishment
that his own picture already smudgily
adorned these latest extras. And men and
women, gone wild over this young conqueror
of the skies, were scrambling for these
pictures.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last the efficient Tokio police rescued
Hal Dane from the rough-and-tumble admiration
of the street crowds. Somehow they got
him free and rushed him into a building. And
here Hal found himself shaking hands with
Charles MacVeagh, American Ambassador to
Japan. Here he met Baron Giichi Tanaka,
Premier of Japan; Suzuki, the Home Minister;
Mitsuchi, head of Finance Department,
and other notable figures of the Japanese
capital,—statesmen whose names were known
all over the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although he was now in a daze of weariness,
young Dane forced himself to answer
quietly and simply their many questions. To
hold the fascinated interest of such great men
was an overwhelming honor. But something
besides honor was overwhelming the gallant
aviator. Sleep, sleep—how he ached for it!</p>

<p class='c008'>Then next thing, he was stretching out his
weary bones in the deep comfort of a bed and
getting his first real rest in two days and the
better part of two nights.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he at last awoke, he found that in all
reality he had written his name across the
sky! Newspapers in all the cities of the world
were giving pages of space to his marvelous
flight. Telegrams of congratulation swamped
him in ten thousand yellow flutters of good
wishes. Crowds surrounded the walls of the
American Embassy begging the “honorable
one” but to show himself. Tokio outdid herself
to pay him honor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All Japan breathes a welcome to the great
flyer of the skies” were the headlines of a
newspaper. And all Japan extended him uncounted
courtesies. There was an endless
round of processions and receptions in his
honor. He was introduced to the romance of
the symbolic “No” dance, the dainty tea ceremony,
the elaborate Kabuki Drama, fruit of
thirty centuries of culture and tradition. He
must see the royal wrestlers, and the strange
sword-dance of old Japan.</p>

<p class='c008'>On a fete day, he had the tremendous
honor of riding the streets of Tokio in a great,
closed, red Rolls-Royce, seated beside His
Highness Hirohito, Emperor of Japan. And
seeing the rider of the skypath seated with
their own beloved Son of the Sun, all that
Japanese throng kneeled. Long after the
crimson limousine had passed, the crowd still
held its awed position.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a week, Hal Dane “saw” Japan from
sacred Fuiji’s mountain crest to the beautiful,
sinister hot lakes of Kannawa.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then America refused to wait longer for
her idol to return. Again the hordes of telegrams
began pouring in.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was one from Hal Dane’s mother,
that simply said, “We knew you could do it—come
back to us now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Vallant, the millionaire giver of aviation
prizes, cabled, “You have won it. Your thirty-five
thousand is waiting for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>From the President of the United States
came a radio message, “Your victory is all
victory—a peaceful victory. You have bound
nations together with a bond of friendship.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And still they flooded in—telegrams, cablegrams,
radiograms. From the first, America
had gone wild with joy and pride over the
matchless flight. And now with the passing
days, America grew frantic, would be no
longer denied. “Come back—You belong to
us—America awaits you!” was the thousandfold
message from his homeland.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under this urge, Hal Dane left sightseeing
in Japan to be completed on some other visit
and saw to it that his beloved Wind Bird was
carefully crated for shipment. Then the
young Viking of the Sky boarded a great
steamer for another crossing of the Pacific—this
time for a journey straight into the
hearts of his own people.</p>
